Juicy and explosive on the palate in cherry, raspberry, forest floor and jolts of cardamom, it's both lush and toasty, with a firmness to the tannin structure that suggests plenty of aging potential.

Pride Mountain 2006 Vintner Select Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"What a fine, beautiful wine this is. Shows every graceful aspect of a modern Napa Cab, from the perfectly ripened fruit to the unbelievably fine tannins and application of oak.

Rubicon Estate 2005 Rubicon Red (Rutherford),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",96,"Made from 98% Cabernet Sauvignon, with no Merlot or Cabernet Franc for the first time, the '05 Rubicon tastes bigger and more impenetrable than any previous vintage. It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals.

Ultra-ripe and lush, but very dry, showing powerful, long hangtime flavors of black and red sour cherries, currants, violets and cedar, wrapped into dense, melted tannins.

Domaine Jacques Prieur 2009 Chambertin  (Chambertin),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"A powerful, classic Chambertin, intensely structured and tannic.

As it develops, this wine will be sumptuous, ripe and impressive. Wait until 2023.",142,Roche de Bellene,France,Burgundy,Corton
Foxen 2014 John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"light, fruity",95,"Fresh and tart wild cherry and crushed cranberry meet with intriguing touches of fennel frond, mustard, rose hips, potpourri and tons of garrigue on the nose of this bottling. The palate packs vibrancy into each sip, redolent with flavors of tomato leaf, cherry tomato, kalamata olive, underripe raspberry, anise, bay leaf and even earthy mugwort. It conveys an extreme sense of place.",48,Foxen,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Horsepower 2013 Sur Echalas Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Syrah,"full bodied, robust",95,"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism.",120,Horsepower,US,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Foxen 2014 Block 8 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"light, fruity",95,"Hearty plum, deep rose petal, earthy juniper, a touch of charcoal and crushed graphite aromas show strongly on the nose of this bottling from a tiny block in this historic vineyard. The palate packs an awesome combination of tension, energy and power, like a clenched fist in a silk glove, with tangy olallieberry fruit and a menthol character that carries deep into the finish.",62,Foxen,US,California,Santa Maria Valley
Domaine Eden 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"While this wine's Mount Eden sister bottling may better stand the test of time, the Domaine Eden is what most people will most like to drink right now, and it's cheaper too. Aromas of dried violets, uncrushed boysenberries and pencil lead make for an ethereal nose that seems to hold secrets one must uncover. Precise tannins on the palate offer floral yet savory flavors of black sesame, nori, violet and mulberry. It's mellow yet mysterious.",35,Domaine Eden,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountains
Roche de Bellene 2014  Echézeaux,Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Produced from less than half an acre of the Grand Cru vineyard, the wine has power and dark concentration. It is a rich wine with black fruit and solid tannins that promise long-term aging. The wood aging has given the wine an even richer character, bringing out spice and licorice flavors.

Roche de Bellene 2014  Clos Saint-Denis,Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This Grand Cru is the smallest in the village of Morey Saint-Denis, located north of the village.

Domaines Devillard 2014 Domaine des Perdrix  (Echézeaux),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Produced from two parcels totaling 2.8 acres, this is a properly powerful wine. It has a concentrated texture and firm tannins. They are balanced with the black fruits and strongly mineral texture of this impressive wine.

Dehlinger 2013 Champ de Mars Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"What a powerfully lovely, lilting and blockbuster of a wine this is. Seamless in baked rhubarb and a velvety texture it never stops impressing, allowing for nuanced explosions of black cherry and Asian spice to coat the palate and become more complex the longer each sip lingers. Deliciously drinkable now, the wine will take on additional wow factor over time.",65,Dehlinger,US,California,Russian River Valley
Cayuse 2013 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Syrah,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Out of the gate this wine reveals quite savory aromas of stems, fire pit, soot, black olive and light flowers.

Sprinklings of white pepper and clove factor in.",58,Limerick Lane,US,California,Russian River Valley
Clos de la Tech 2012 Domaine Du Docteur Rodgers Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"This bottling from a winery that uses both the highest of technology and most old school of techniques is incredibly subtle at first, but then come waves of mace, mulberry, forest floor and dried shiitake aromas. The palate starts with sharper herbs and spice, from thyme to nutmeg and allspice, and then the purple flower flavors explode like a bouquet in the mouth. Elderflower touches fly into the finish.",102,Clos de la Tech,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountains
Shea 2014 Shea Vineyard Homer Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Homer is the winery's top level reserve cuvée.

Big Basin 2014 Lester Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"Winemaker Bradley Brown manages to capture all of the redwood forest-like spice of this region in his lithe bottlings.

The Eyrie Vineyards 2014 Original Vines Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"These are in fact the original Pinot Noir vines planted in the Willamette Valley, back in the mid-1960s. An explosion of sensory detail quickly opens up the wine, with pollen, sandalwood, sassafras and coffee grounds. Those flavors wrap around blackberry, licorice and cola, continuing to expand and explore the far reaches of the palate. Phylloxera may soon eliminate these vines, so don't wait to acquire a bit of history in a bottle.",80,The Eyrie Vineyards,US,Oregon,Dundee Hills
Dragonette 2013 MJM Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),Red,Syrah,"full bodied, robust",95,"There are excellent savory qualities to this bottling, with white pepper, charred lamb, soy and pine resin adding much intrigue to the black currant fruit. The umami character is strong on the sip, with beef jerky, black pepper and wild mushroom broth flavors, but there is also some tangy fruit as well as upright tannins that will keep this wine singing for years.

Shafer 2013 Relentless Syrah (Napa Valley),Red,Syrah,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is a stunning, vibrantly robust and intense wine, big, bold and reductive and blended with 3% Petite Sirah.

Clos de la Tech 2012 Domaine Lois Louise Cote Sud Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from tech power couple T.J. and Valeta Rodgers offers rich aromas of dried Mission fig, elderberry and black cherry, along with clay, loam and purple flowers. There is an impressive, almost muddy thickness to the palate, without being sweet or rich at all, showing flavors thyme, dill, mint and lavender against a core of dark red fruit.",82,Clos de la Tech,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountains
Big Basin 2014 Coast Grade Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ben Lomond Mountain),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"This wine is a study of how to make Pinot Noir both extremely light and yet powerfully flavorful.

It's easy to guzzle.",48,Big Basin,US,California,Ben Lomond Mountain
Sbragia 2006 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.",50,Sbragia,US,California,Sonoma Valley
Sbragia 2006 Cimarossa Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Ed Sbragia is making some of the most interesting single-vineyard Cabernets in California. This one, from Howell Mountain, shows the density and power that typify all his wines.

Feels like it has the capacity to age for decades.",75,Sbragia,US,California,Howell Mountain
Luciano Sandrone 2005 Cannubi Boschis  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"One of the most exciting names in Barolo, with fruit from one of the most celebrated vineyard crus, this vintage of Cannubi Boschis is a real treasure.

The wine already shows incredibly complex aromas of wild berry fruit, truffle and cola and those tones will surely become more elegant with time.",165,Luciano Sandrone,Italy,Piedmont,Barolo
Sierra Cantabria 2006 Amancio  (Rioja),Red,Tempranillo,"full bodied, robust",95,"Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas.

Blackbird Vineyards 2007 Paramour Red (Napa Valley),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Some wines are meant for immediate consumption. Others require age. This wonderful wine satisfies on both sides. It's softly rich and polished in tannins, with accessible blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. Yet it has the structure and depth to go for years. Now–2016, at least.",90,Blackbird Vineyards,US,California,Napa Valley
Giacomo Grimaldi 2005 Le Coste  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Founded in 1930 by Ferruccio Grimaldi, this family-run estate is now showing some very exciting results.

Château Branaire-Ducru 2000  Saint-Julien,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"light, fruity",95,"Here is a huge ripe and luxurious wine, with great power.

Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien.",40,Château Branaire-Ducru,France,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien
Williams Selyem 2012 Bucher Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"This is beautifully lilting in preciously defined aromas of rose petal and wild strawberry. From there, it's all subtlety and ethereal elegance. The wine is restrained, nurtured in a basket of nutmeg and graham cracker, as well as freshly packed mushroomy earth. This wine is a stunner right out of the glass, but is sure to continue its fine course through 2022–2025.",59,Williams Selyem,US,California,Russian River Valley
Darioush 2011 Signature Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"Sanguine and brooding in dense layers of juicy black fruit, leather and tobacco, this is classic Napa Valley Cabernet with an elegance at its core, that's also seamless, complex and age-worthy.

The Eyrie Vineyards 2012 Original Vines Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Separate from the other Original Vines bottling, this is part of the new single-vineyard series, and includes the famed South Block grapes.

Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2011 Édition Limitée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"A block selection, this most rare offering from DDO has rippingly good aromatics, intense and complex, with dusty, dreamy spices wrapped around a seamless mix of berry, earth and herbal components. The somewhat gritty texture gives it muscle and length, and the overall complexity suggests it can age for up to a quarter century.

Darioush 2011 Signature Series Shiraz (Napa Valley),Red,Shiraz,"full bodied, robust",95,"Full-bodied and exuberant in lush tannins, this black Shiraz is concentrated and rich in hearty leather, espresso and black tea yet buoyed by lively acidity and beautiful streaks of black and white pepper.

Shea 2012 Shea Vineyard Homer Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"light, fruity",95,"Homer is the estate reserve, wood-tank fermented and blended from the winemaker's best barrels.

Williams Selyem 2012 Williams Selyem Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,other,95,"Silky on the palate, this offers exotic aromas of orange blossom and spicy cardamom. Juicy in fresh cherry, it combines structured elegance and plenty of power, amid a mouthwatering quality that's seductively delicious and yet just begs the question of how much more nuanced the flavors will be in time. Drink through 2022.",105,Williams Selyem,US,California,Russian River Valley
Williams Selyem 2012 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"light, fruity",95,"Fresh-picked Bing cherry delights on the initial entry into this silky Pinot, sourced from a long-famous site in the heart of the Russian River.

Enjoy through 2022.",79,Williams Selyem,US,California,Russian River Valley
Sineann 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Columbia Gorge (OR)),Red,Zinfandel,other,95,"Even by past standards, this new vintage of Sineann's Old Vine Zin is spectacular, with ripe, jammy, concentrated fruit flavors of fig, black cherry and purple plum. The balance among the fruit, acidity, tannin and alcohol is spot-on, without blowing away the more subtle compexity of the old vine fruit.",39,Sineann,US,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR)
Williams Selyem 2012 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This vineyard-designated wine reflects its sense of place remarkably well, offering tight dark cherry and blueberry around a strong character of wild earth, tea and herb. High in acidity and minerality, and yet powerfully understated, it's gorgeously drinkable now but will gain further complexity through 2022.",78,Williams Selyem,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Laetitia 2012 La Colline Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This hillside-grown wine is only vineyard-designated in special vintages. The nose is like a delicate pine sap, with elements of spearmint, sweet camphor and anise set against light raspberry juice. It's elegant but energetic, with soy sauce, clove and menthol highlighting the hibiscus and red and purple fruits.",60,Laetitia,US,California,Arroyo Grande Valley
Abeja 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"light, fruity",97,"Sourced from old-vine Bacchus and Weinbau fruit, this also includes 20% grapes from the estate's Heather Hill vineyard. The aromas are dense and penetrating, with a powerful mix of black fruits, ripe berries, smoke, earth, olive and coffee. From the first sniff to the last swallow, the flavors are beautifully integrated and the effect symphonic.",85,Abeja,US,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA)
Samsara 2008 Las Hermanas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",96,"An exotic Pinot Noir, feral and exciting in its appeal. Wildly complex, with the scents of a summertime walk through a coastal California woodland. Forest floor, mushroom, wild cherries and raspberries, roasted shank bone, licorice, sandalwood—the flavors go on and on, balanced with crisp acidity. So dry; a joy to experience.",44,Samsara,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Abeja 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red,Merlot,"full bodied, robust",95,"This 100% Merlot is sourced from Sagemoor Farms' Bacchus and Dionysus vineyards. For the first time, there is no Cabernet Franc in the blend.

Thick and flat-out luscious, yet structured with a tannic spine that gives definition and focus all the way through.",38,Abeja,US,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA)
Albert Bichot 2005 Domaine du Clos Frantin Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"A superb wine, the tannins carrying along the dense structure with ease and grace. The purity of the ripe berry fruit is very marked, with acidity giving freshness to the sweet wine. The whole ensemble is developing well, but will need many years' aging.",115,Albert Bichot,France,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée
Louis Jadot 2005 Les Baudes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This is a wonderful wine, very ripe, the blackberry and sweet fruits all here, While the tannins are solid and concentrated, they are in the center of a lush, beautifully rich series of flavors that range from fruit to licorice to spice. The wine shows great aging potential.",95,Louis Jadot,France,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny
Standish 2006 The Relic Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Red,Shiraz,"full bodied, robust",98,"This prodigious wine showcases Barossa's ability to deliver big, mouthfilling flavors without any suggestion of heat or heaviness. Scents of stone fruit, pepper and red currants mark the nose, while the flavors take on a darker cast, heading toward black cherries and black olives. The tannins are supremely silky, but this graceful, feminine beauty should drink well through at least 2020.",135,Standish,Australia,South Australia,Barossa Valley
Williams Selyem 2007 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that.",78,Williams Selyem,US,California,Russian River Valley
Baldacci 2006 Brenda's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Easily earns its high score for the sheer power and mass, equal to anything out of Napa. Erupts in the most complex blackberries, black currants, licorice and 100% new smoky oak flavors, with a spicy finish that goes on and on. The tannins are strong and fine and impressive. Not for the faint-hearted, and not a wine to drink now, as it will swamp food. Should begin to emerge after 2012.",85,Baldacci,US,California,Stags Leap District
Standish 2005 The Standish Single Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Red,Shiraz,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"If Standish's Relic is the feminine side of Shiraz, this is in a more masculine vein, with slightly coarser tannins and more weight, but still possessing great intensity without any heaviness. Cassis, blueberry and black olive flavors are tinged with hints of asphalt and espresso, leading into a warm, lingering finish. Drink now-2025.",135,Standish,Australia,South Australia,Barossa Valley
Sbragia 2006 Rancho Del Oso Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This is the most accessible, most interesting and most compelling of Sbragia's new Cabernets. It's extraordinarily powerful in the potent, sweetly refined tannins and ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, leading to a long, rich finish. You can drink it now, but it will age effortlessly for a good 8–10 years.",75,Sbragia,US,California,Howell Mountain
Sbragia 2006 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.",50,Sbragia,US,California,Sonoma Valley
Knights Bridge 2007 Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Beautiful from start to finish, but tannic, and not drinkable now, in the classic sense. The tannins are hard, and while they're very finely ground, they prevent the palate from full appreciation of the lush blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate and herbs. Give this 100% Cabernet at least five years to begin to mellow.",110,Knights Bridge,US,California,Napa Valley
Williams Selyem 2007 Peay Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Pretty tannic, with a hard edge, although it's very fruity and rich, and should soften and mellow with time in the cellar. Thoroughly dry, it shows complex flavors of wild raspberries, cherry compote, cola and spices, compounded with smoky, sweet oak. Give it until 2011 to begin to come around.",54,Williams Selyem,US,California,Russian River Valley
Tenuta San Guido 2012 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia),Red,Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",99,"One of Italy's most iconic bottlings, the 2012 Sassicaia is drop-dead gorgeous. A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc, it boasts sensations of blue flowers, cedar, juicy red currants, ripe raspberries, white pepper and a balsamic note. Structured, radiant and loaded with finesse, it delivers everything you'd expect from a world-class wine and more. Drink 2018–2032.",235,Tenuta San Guido,Italy,Tuscany,Bolgheri Sassicaia
Marchesi Antinori 2012 Solaia Red (Toscana),Red,Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"This stunning expression of Solaia opens with ample aromas of exotic spices, tilled soil, mature black-skinned fruit and an underlying whiff of fragrant blue flowers. The vibrant, elegantly structured palate doles out high-toned black cherry, ripe blackberry, white pepper, cinnamon, clove and Mediterranean herbs alongside a backbone of firm, polished tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2017–2032.",325,Marchesi Antinori,Italy,Tuscany,Toscana
W.H. Smith 2010 Hellenthal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"From a vineyard in the Fort Ross-Seaview appellation, this is clearly one of the best wines of the vintage. The mouthfeel is light and silky, with refined tannins that give it a slight astringency. The flavors are vast and complex with raspberries, cherries and cola, but also forest notes of mushrooms, balsam and herbs. The acidity is fresh and appealing. It's gorgeous now, and should evolve over the next 15 years.",48,W.H. Smith,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Paul Hobbs 2011 Katherine Lindsay Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"This bottling by Hobbs typically is a compelling Pinot Noir, but with the 2011 vintage, they've exceeded even the outstanding 2010. The wine is extraordinarily delicate in the mouth, with a cloud-like airiness that's like pure silk. Yet there are powerful raspberry, cherry, herb, cassis, mushroom and sandalwood flavors that are a delight to experience. The wine has none of the unripe vegetal notes that mar so many other 2011 Pinot Noirs. Drink this gorgeous wine now and over the next 10 years.",85,Paul Hobbs,US,California,Russian River Valley
W.H. Smith 2010 Maritime Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"The Maritime bottling traditionally has represented some of the highest expressions of W.H. Smith's various Pinot Noirs. Gentle and yet complex, it opens with notes of raspberries and cherries accented with mushrooms and minerals. There's a deep, brooding earthiness, along with all sorts of spiced orange-rind and sandalwood notes. A great effort, and one of the best Pinots of the vintage. Drink now through 2020.",54,W.H. Smith,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Diamond Creek 2010 Red Rock Terrace Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"You'll find the hard tannins associated with Diamond Creek's Cabs, as well as an iodine, metallic brittleness to this wine. The combination of the two makes this as tough as any young Napa Valley Cabernet could be. However, the core is potent, suggesting intensely concentrated black currants and blackberries, reduced to their elemental essence. Do not touch this wine before 2020, and it should still be going strong in 2030.",200,Diamond Creek,US,California,Diamond Mountain District
Girard 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Where Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search.",75,Girard,US,California,Diamond Mountain District
Beaulieu Vineyard 2005 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent. This is one for the cellar and will age for at least a decade and probably far longer. Try to keep your hands off it until after 2011.",105,Beaulieu Vineyard,US,California,Napa Valley
Duckhorn 2004 Red Wine Red (Howell Mountain),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets. Cellar until 2010, and it should reward for years after.",75,Duckhorn,US,California,Howell Mountain
Viñedos de Paganos 2005 El Puntido  (Rioja),Red,Tempranillo Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Our wine of the year in 2007 (the '04 El Puntido) is back with a vengeance in the 2005 vintage. This is a deep-fruited modern specimen with that elusive mix of floral, fruit and meaty characteristics. The palate is ripe and everlasting, with berry, coffee and hickory flavors. Long and calm on the finish, with amazing texture. An excellent encore to the prior year's achievement.",65,Viñedos de Paganos,Spain,Northern Spain,Rioja
Yao Ming 2010 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",98,"We can debate the pricing on Yao Ming's new reserve, but what's undeniable, by any modern standard, is the wine's excellence. A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It's delicious in blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors, and well structured in acids and tannins. The wine should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years.",625,Yao Ming,US,California,Napa Valley
Monteraponi 2010 Baron' Ugo Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Red,Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Here's a gorgeous Chianti Classico that shows great intensity, breeding and class. It opens with quintessential varietal aromas of leather, blue flower, berry and spice. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, white pepper, cinnamon and mint alongside bracing but refined tannins and fresh acidity.

Finca Perdriel 2007 Vineyard Selection Red (Mendoza),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,other,95,"This is a supreme small-lot Argentine wine from lauded winemaker Jorge Riccitelli. The blend is 70% Malbec with 20% Cabernet and 10% Merlot. Aromas of loam, wild berry and vanilla are elegant and exciting.

The tannins are strong, yet smooth and refined. The wine is so gorgeous right out of the bottle, you can drink it now, but try giving it six more years to really show its stuff.",118,En Garde,US,California,Diamond Mountain District
Prime Solum 2010 Brokenrock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This exciting project comes from veteran winemaker William Hill. Although it's packed with rich black-currant and cassis-liqueur flavors that sink down in the midpalate and offer fruity satisfaction, the finish is firm and classic. The vineyard is on Atlas Peak, and the wine shows those mountain tannins but also fine minerality. Drink 2017–2025.",80,Prime Solum,US,California,Napa Valley
Yao Ming 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"This fabulous Cabernet has been blended with Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.

Penfolds 2009 Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Penfolds Bin 707 has leapt in quality over the past few vintages. The 2009 features hints of mint, cedar and vanilla accenting ripe cassis fruit.

Venge 2011 Bone Ash Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is made from 100% Cabernet grown in the St. Helena estate vineyard. The wine is exceptionally pure and delicious, rich in black currant, chocolate, black cherry and lots of toasty new French oak. The all-important tannins are exquisitely ripe and as fine as velvet.

David Arthur 2010 Elevation 1147' Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"Here we have a fascinating wine that's elegant and opulent, massive and controlled, flattering yet elusive, all at once. That combination of opposites gives it intellectual interest, a wine worth thinking and talking about. Technically, it's dry, fairly high in alcohol and oaky. The 100% Cabernet grapes off the estate are incredibly concentrated in black currants and cassis, showing their sunny, high elevation origins on Pritchard Hill. The wine is not perfect. There's a certain hollowness mid-palate, which has to be attributed to the challenging vintage. But it's a fabulous Cabernet to drink now, and it will reward cellaring for 10 years.",175,David Arthur,US,California,Napa Valley
Hall 2010 Exzellenz Sacrashe Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Made from 100% Cab, the grapes once again show what the vineyard, in the hills east of the Silverado Trail, can do. The French oak was 90% new, which would swamp a lesser wine, but not this one. It's rich, full and concentrated, with excellent structure and balance. Drink now, after careful decanting, and through 2020.",200,Hall,US,California,Rutherford
Monteraponi 2010 Il Campitello Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Red,Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This stunning wine opens with a multifaceted fragrance of underbrush, leather, spice, woodland berries and violets, with a whiff of mint.

Holus Bolus 2013 Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),Red,Syrah,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Though this bottling is Peter Hunken's least-expensive Syrah, it gives his single-vineyard expressions a serious run for the money for best of vintage. Amazing aromas of chipped asphalt, smoked beef, dense boysenberry, soy, cedar, sandalwood and soy drop into a palate of peppery berry juice, beef jerky, underripe blackberry and elderberry, and pepper-crusted teriyaki beef.",32,Holus Bolus,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley),Red,Shiraz,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood.

This is a huge wine, but it's not exaggerated and the finish is as long and smooth as they come.",320,Le Macchiole,Italy,Tuscany,Toscana
Vine Cliff 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",98,"Pretty much as good as Napa Cabernet gets. Shows the blackberries, black currants, blueberries and spicy plums of Oakville and scads of spices, and the tannin-acid structure is, in a word, superb. The oak elaboration is just about perfect, adding a tasteful layer of smoky, buttered toast. The finish goes on and on.",75,Vine Cliff,US,California,Oakville
Vine Cliff 2007 16 Rows Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",97,"A true sensation. Shows the richness and concentration you want in a great Napa Cab, but also a structure that lifts it above the soft, mushy wines that are so prevalent. There's real tannin and acid architecture framing the opulent blackberry, black currant, mineral and cedar flavors, and the finish is dry, dry, dry. Every sip offers something different as it changes in the glass. A world-class wine that defines elegance, power and complexity.

Hall 2007 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"One of the richest Cabernets of the vintage. Amazingly soft and velvety in the mouth, yet there's a solid grip of acidity and tannins that balance the richness.

Brogan 2007 Buena Prierra Vineyard Helio Doro Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"So dry, so crisply acidic, so silky in the mouth, and so rich in flavor. This is a truly distinctive Pinot Noir. It shows the variety's elusive personality, now rich in cherries and currants, withdrawing into minerals and herbs.

Clos Troteligotte 2012 K-2 Malbec (Cahors),Red,Malbec,"full bodied, robust",95,"This dense and dark wine is showing as much tannin as fruit at this stage.

Penfolds 1996 Grange Shiraz (South Australia),Red,Shiraz,"full bodied, robust",96,"As unevolved as they are, the dense and multilayered aromas and flavors are truly impressive here. Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01.",185,Penfolds,Australia,South Australia,South Australia

Blackberry, menthol and smoke play unusually elegantly on the nose, the texture is velvet on the tongue with dark berry, coffee, licorice and muted black pepper flavors.

Williams Selyem 2010 30th Anniversary Cuvée Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",97,"This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022.

Merry Edwards 2010 Klopp Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This vineyard has been source to some of the winery's greatest bottlings. The wine is enormously fruity, with raspberry, cherry and red-plum flavors that flood the palate.

Merry Edwards 2010 Meredith Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This is an amazingly complex wine and a fine expression of the cool vintage. Perhaps the most notable feature is acidity; it's strong, almost tingly, and will certainly help the wine age. The flavors are explosive yet refined, with notes of cherries, cola, pomegranates and plums. Good as it is to drink now, you'll want to cellar it until 2018, and it will provide beauty for many additional years.",57,Merry Edwards,US,California,Russian River Valley
Araujo 2007 Eisele Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",98,"Profoundly beautiful aroma on this Cab, a perfect union of oaky char and vanilla with ripe blackberries and cassis. Hard to exaggerate the beauty. Powerful, yet never pushy, with classic Napa balance. Rich, sweet, almost meaty, with massive tannins that are refined and smooth. Very great density and weight. Really defines the vineyard, and should age effortlessly for 20 years",275,Araujo,US,California,Napa Valley
Donelan 2008 Richards Family Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Valley),Red,Syrah,"full bodied, robust",97,"This is not only one of the best Syrahs of the vintage, it's easily the greatest Syrah ever produced from Sonoma Valley. Stuns with its soft,  complex, black and blue berry, teriaki beef, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. The depth is unbelievable, the length impressive.

Hall 2007 Exzellenz Red Wine Sacrashe Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"Expensive, yes, but this is a very great Cabernet, and the Sacrashe Vineyard repeatedly proves itself as one of the best in Rutherford, if not Napa Valley itself. The 100% Cabernet, which is a limited production barrel selection of only 420 cases, is so delicious in blackberry jam, chocolate, olive and cedar flavors, it's hard to not drain the bottle now. But it also shows fabulously rich tannins that suggest aging. May not be one for the long haul, but certainly great over the next six years.",165,Hall,US,California,Rutherford
Reynolds Family Winery 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"A big, vital and important Cabernet that deserves a place in the cellar. It hits the mouth with huge tannins that are tight and locked down, yet sweetly ripe. That contradiction persists throughout the fantastically complex blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors. A very fine, superior wine that exemplifies the Stags Leap iron fist in a velvet glove. As delicious as it is, you should hold this Cabernet for a good six years, and it could easily develop for an additional decade.",89,Reynolds Family Winery,US,California,Stags Leap District
Staglin 2007 INEO Red (Napa Valley),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Here's a young, strong, vigorous wine that needs cellar time.

Macauley 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"A stunningly good Cabernet. Just dazzling in sheer delicious fruit, yet wonderfully structured. So smooth and velvety, flooding the mouth with layers of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, mint, spice and toast. The tannins are thrilling, being firm and soft at the same time.

Very great now, and should develop over the next 10 years.",72,Macauley,US,California,Napa Valley
Venge 2008 Bone Ash Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"A beautiful, brilliant but immature Cabernet.

Failla 2009 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"light, fruity",95,"Failla has been working with the fruit from this coveted vineyard for a long time, and has figured it out better than anyone.

Domaine Serene 2007 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"A very elegant and refined Evenstad Reserve, with grace notes of sandalwood and a lovely cherry core. The fruit is immaculate, the concentration focused and lengthy, and the flavors are so artfully blended that the wine is seamless and perfectly balanced.

Salvestrin 2007 3D Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Sweet new oak stands out, giving this Cabernet caramel aromas and flavors. But the oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's massive power. Underneath the wood char is a dry, tannic wine with rich blackberry and currant flavors. It's a bit disjointed now, needing time for everything to mesh together. Could be really something around 2015.",125,Salvestrin,US,California,St. Helena
Lynmar 2007 Hawk Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",97,"An extraordinarily lush, dramatic Pinot Noir.

Château du Cèdre 2012 GC Malbec (Cahors),Red,Malbec,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"While this is the top wine of a major Cahors estate, it is impressive how restrained it is. Sure, the wood and dense brooding black fruits are there, but they have been subtly controlled by the freshness of the wine and its great balance.

The palate is saturated and smooth, with black cherry and blackberry flavors leading the way. Coffee, berry pie and mocha help the finish hold court and then fade away. Already good but best from 2010–2020.",165,Marqués de Murrieta,Spain,Northern Spain,Rioja
Standish 2005 Mayflower Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is the smoothest, most polished of Standish's quartet of new Pinots. It's a best-of-barrels selection, and really impressive in cherry, currant, licorice, cola and Provençal herbs. With near-perfect balance, it exemplifies Anderson Valley and also is a standout in the great 2005 vintage. It was crafted, under Standish's “guest winemaker” program, by Zach Rasmussen, of Goldeneye.",80,Standish,US,California,Anderson Valley
Breggo 2006 Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"If you know Goldeneye's new Gowen Creek bottling, this is a near identical Pinot, and little wonder, for the vineyards are right next to each other. This wine dazzles with exotic, feral notes of wild blackberries and blueberries, and forest scents of pine needle, roasted mushroom, grilled meat, chocolate, anise, cinnamon, nutmeg and coriander. New oak adds even richer nuances of smoky caramel and vanilla to this compelling wine.",55,Breggo,US,California,Anderson Valley
Louis Jadot 2005 Les Baudes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Red,Pinot Noir,"light, fruity",95,"Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance. It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness. And, at the end, just to give a great lift, along comes the acidity.",90,Louis Jadot,France,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny
Vall Llach 2005 Red (Priorat),Red,Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"For the second vintage in a row, Vall Llach's signature red blend is out on its own. The bouquet is round and deep, with alluring cola, mint and blackberry aromas. The palate is alive but still quite dark, with huge black plum and blackberry flavors. Super long on the finish, with a subtle streak of vanilla and coconut. Delicious but also deft. 450 cases produced.",85,Vall Llach,Spain,Catalonia,Priorat
Kendall-Jackson 2006 Highland Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",97,"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins.

Hartford Court 2007 Hailey's Block Pinot Noir (Green Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This is from a block of younger vines made from Dijon clones within the larger Arrendell Vineyard. The wine is quite full-bodied and robust, almost rustic, which is mainly due to the powerful, young tannins. With explosive berry, currant and mocha flavors, this powerful wine should hit its stride in mid-2010.",60,Hartford Court,US,California,Green Valley
Harlan Estate 2005 The Maiden Red (Napa Valley),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",97,"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful.

Harlan Estate 2005 Red (Napa Valley),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"Smells a bit minty and peppery, but once in the mouth, turns ultra-generous in black currant, chocolate-covered mint and spicy cedar flavors. Massive, yet refined and elegant, and even with the firm tannins, grows more charming as it warms in the glass. Very fine quality, and likely to hold for many years.",450,Harlan Estate,US,California,Napa Valley
Joseph Phelps 2005 Insignia Red (Napa Valley),Red,Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.",200,Joseph Phelps,US,California,Napa Valley
Lost Canyon 2007 Widdoes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"Voluptuous, lush, a wine of great power.

Oakville East 2005 Exposure Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power. This serious new Napa Cab is great now, and should develop for many years.",125,Oakville East,US,California,Oakville
Janzen 2007 Cloudy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"A beautiful, classy Cab, marked by smoky new oak and very ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with a streak of minerals. The vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, in the valley's far east. You can taste the sunshine in the wonderful fruitiness, and the tannins are extraordinarily refined, but they're also aggressive. Fine now, with a long decant, but should develop bottle complexity over many years.",100,Janzen,US,California,Napa Valley
Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.",100,Steven Kent,US,California,Livermore Valley
Fulcrum 2008 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices. Super-complex, it changes with every sip, and should change interestingly over the next six years. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future.",52,Fulcrum,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Ojai 2005 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"This wine is as fine as anything from Santa Rita Hills. Although it's young and tight now, its future is assured by the brilliant combination of audacious fruit and classic structure.

Shafer 2003 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Solidly in the Hillside Select model, this vigorous young Cab is dramatically ripe and powerful. The flavors of red and black currants, milk chocolate, figs and smoky vanilla erupt in the mouth, making the tastebuds jump with joy. However, there is also the structure, among the greatest in California Cabs. The acidity is fine, but the tannins are stupendously rich, sweet and complex, practically a food group in themselves. Stunning and gorgeous now in its youth, this collectible wine will reward at least through 2015.",200,Shafer,US,California,Stags Leap District
Poggio Nardone 2001 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Red,Sangiovese,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"A liquid lullaby more than a wine, this Brunello caresses and smoothes over your senses with amazing intensity and harmonious aromas of cherry-chocolate fudge, almond paste, ginger, balsamic notes, blueberry pie, firewood and vanilla.

Novy 2005 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),Red,Syrah,"full bodied, robust",95,"Dark and racy, with a Northern Rhône-style aroma of black pepper, cedar and black currants, but there's nothing Rhône-like about the flavor. It's distinctly California, with soft, sweetly ripe tannins bursting with blackberry jam, black currants, anise, vanilla and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry.

Rita Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"This wine's magically layered nose blends graphite, black cherries, dried violets, hints of savory smoke meats and the oddly captivating scent of composting rose petals.

Alex Gambal 2013  Charmes-Chambertin,Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"Produced from organically grown grapes, this structured wine is complex and still very closed up, with dense tannins and dark fruit.

Domaine Méo-Camuzet 2013  Clos de Vougeot,Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"Toasty aromas are not enough to smother the intense, rich and concentrated fruitiness of this powerful wine.

Knights Bridge 2009 Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"Dusty tannins and notes of dried herbs give this vigorous young Cabernet a mark of immaturity that strongly suggests time in the cellar, despite flashy blackberry and black currant flavors.

Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft.

The tannins are there, though, a power to thrust this immense wine well into the future. It is well formed, firm while rich. Drink from 2024.",530,Albert Bichot,France,Burgundy,Chambertin
Mauro 2011 VS Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),Red,Tempranillo,"full bodied, robust",96,"Lusty aromas of black cherry and blackberry are powerful. Likewise, this Tempranillo from just outside the Ribera del Duero district tastes bullish, with blackberry, currant, mocha and rich oak flavors. Robust berry fruit along with spice and chocolate are the lead flavors on a strong, dense finish. This has the potential to age nicely for seven to 15 years. Drink through 2030.",100,Mauro,Spain,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León
Terre Rouge 2013 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),Red,Syrah,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"This is the small-production, flagship wine from the Sierra region's best producer of Rhône-style wines. Lovely, spicy, floral aromas and generous, complex and layered flavors make the wine irresistible, while its strong but velvety texture sets it up for a long life in the cellar for those who can resist. It smells lightly oaky, like a cigar box and cocoa, tastes deep and focused on blackberry, pomegranate and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is both rich and a bit reserved. Best to drink from 2020 to 2030.",90,Terre Rouge,US,California,Sierra Foothills
Albert Bichot 2014 Domaine du Clos Frantin  (Grands-Echezeaux),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"This massive wine is powered by dark, concentrated and smoky tannins that are masking the fruit. Dry and dense, it will take many years for the black fruits behind the facade to develop. Drink this intense wine from 2025.",385,Albert Bichot,France,Burgundy,Grands-Echezeaux
Hourglass 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"An extremely dark color sets an expectation of concentration, and this full-bodied but velvet-textured wine delivers it. In the aroma are cocoa and licorice and dark-skinned cherries, then the flavors resemble a rich blackberry cherry syrup without the sweetness. The wine tastes exceptionally rich but not heavy. Best from 2020 through 2030.",185,Hourglass,US,California,Napa Valley
Château Léoville Barton 2010  Saint-Julien,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,other,100,"This is a magnificently solid wine, initially even a bit severe. At this young stage, the tannins dominate, but it's also full of black fruit notes. Very dense and concentrated, this is a wine that's even better than the legendary 2005. The structure tells of its extraordinary aging potential: don't even attempt to drink this for 10 years.",150,Château Léoville Barton,France,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien
Château Léoville Poyferré 2010  Saint-Julien,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",98,"A wine of architectural strength and classical proportions, this has straight lines that mark the packed, concentrated fruits, which are sustained by its tannins. This is certainly the best wine that Léoville-Poyferré has produced, sumptuous while so finely structured.",92,Château Léoville Poyferré,France,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien
Failla 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"This shows the trifecta of winemaker Ehren Jordan's deft hand, the fabulous Hirsch Vineyard and the wonderful 2010 vintage. Even if you knew nothing of the wine's pedigree, you'd be dazzled by its sheer richness of raspberry, cherry, cola and herb flavors, plus the firm, stone-driven minerality, the dryness, the feral mountain hints, the acidity and the overall dazzling structure. The alcohol level is comparatively restrained, providing just the right touch of warmth. New oak clocks in at only 30%, imbuing the wine with a nice seasoning of smoke. Definitely worth searching for, but only 375 cases were produced. Drink this wine now–2022.",70,Failla,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Sanguis 2009 Six White Horses Syrah (California),Red,Syrah,"full bodied, robust",97,"Winemaker Matthias Pippig brings Syrah to a whole new level with this stunningly dramatic bottling. Don't worry about the California appellation, a peculiarity of the winery's ownership. It's made entirely from Santa Barbara grapes, namely from Watch Hill in Los Alamos and Bien Nacido in Santa Maria Valley. The intensity of fruit defies description. It suggests enormous blackberry and creamy-sweet chocolate, larded with bacon and sprinkled with black pepper—and that doesn't even begin to describe the toasty sweetness of the 100% new oak barrels. This is the best California Syrah of the vintage, and one of the greatest Syrahs the state has ever produced. This opulence comes at a cost, however: The alcohol is high.",75,Sanguis,US,California,California
Paul Hobbs 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"This is a pinnacle of the modern style of winemaking in Napa Valley. The tannins are strong but not aggressive. The acidity is just enough to provide balance for the tremendously rich blackberry, black currant, Kahlua and olive flavors. The oak is powerful, but the wine wears it easily. The finish is thoroughly dry, long and spicy. And although the alcohol is high, it's not impossible. You can drink it now, although the tannins could benefit from 6–8 years in the cellar.",275,Paul Hobbs,US,California,Oakville
Goldschmidt 2007 Plus Game Ranch Single Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,other,96,"A dramatic Cabernet, complex and layered, this shows deeply concentrated blackberry essence, black currant, dark chocolate and raisin flaors that are intricately woven with a sweet, smoky oak influence. The tannic structure is thick and furry, but just about perfect. Should age for many years, gradually losing primary fruit, but it's drinkable now after decanting.",150,Goldschmidt,US,California,Oakville
Zaca Mesa 2009 Black Bear Block Estate Grown and Bottled Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),Red,Syrah,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"If the first duty of a wine is to be delicious, this tiny production bottling succeeds beyond all measure. The Black Bear Block is almost always Zaca Mesa's best Syrah among its many releases, and so it is again in 2009. Take one sip and you're dazzled by the refined tannins, dryness and complexity of flavors: blackberry, cassis, plum sauce, mocha, bacon, smoky oak, white pepper, chamomile tea and licorice. What's harder to express is the sheer pleasure of the mouthfeel. This is an exciting Syrah, and may just be at the beginning of a long journey. Drink now and for many years as it slowly changes.",60,Zaca Mesa,US,California,Santa Ynez Valley
Sanguis 2009 Gravity Red (Santa Barbara County),Red,Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Sanguis combines its signature of exceptional power with finesse, producing a wine that is so dramatic as to defy belief. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon provide the blackberry jam and chocolate richness, while Viognier brings a bright floral note, and even Roussanne has something to say by way of orange tartness. New oak is evident, but perfectly in balance with the wine's volume. Stunning and dramatic, but not an ager, so drink up.",70,Sanguis,US,California,Santa Barbara County
La Clarine Farm 2011 Cedarville Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),Red,Mourvèdre,"light, fruity",95,"Light in color, alcohol and texture, this dynamic wine has a fresh pepper flavor, and is gorgeous all around, like drinking fresh rose petals. This could be enjoyed all day long, every day, but with only 51 cases produced, get it now or you'll miss out on it.",24,La Clarine Farm,US,California,Sierra Foothills
La Follette 2010 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),Red,Pinot Noir,"light, fruity",95,"A tremendous wine, this appeals to the senses as well as the intellect. Dry, tart in acidity and somewhat tannic, it shows complex flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, bacon, cinnamon, white pepper and sandalwood. The finish goes on and on. So delicious now, you can hardly keep from drinking it, but this is a Pinot Noir that will age for 6–8 years, gradually losing primary fruit and gaining interesting mushroom and dried fruit notes.",40,La Follette,US,California,Sonoma Mountain
André Brunel 2009 Les Cailloux Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Red,Rhône-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"The 2009 Les Cailloux is a classically built Châteauneuf that should age well through at least 2025. The blend of 65% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and 3% Cinsault starts off with lovely notes of wild thyme and dark fruit, then adds herbal complexity and chocolaty richness. It's full bodied yet firm, with some dusty but elegant tannins on the finish. It's excellent now, but will be even better in 2016 and beyond.",60,André Brunel,France,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape
Daou 2013 Soul of a Lion Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaida District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"This rich, hearty and ultimately lovely blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 8% Petit Verdot still needs time to open up. When it does, expect dense and pure aromas of blueberry, black currant, graphite and nose-tickling spice. The palate's intense structure, though shy for now, reveals charred beef, coffee, caramel, black cherry and dried rose flavors. Drink 2019–2030.",150,Daou,US,California,Adelaida District
Le Potazzine 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,Red,Sangiovese,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Fresh and full of finesse, this radiant red offers rose, forest floor, woodland berry, new leather and pipe tobacco scents.

Baricci 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,Red,Sangiovese,"light, fruity",96,"Enticing perfumed berry, violet, new leather and a truffle scents emerge in this textbook Brunello.

Ridolfi 2012 Mercatale  (Brunello di Montalcino),Red,Sangiovese,"full bodied, robust",95,"Truffle, leather, forest floor, pipe tobacco and purple flower aromas all come together in this young, balanced Brunello. The palate is taut and chewy, with a nervous tension that offsets its juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry, licorice and clove flavors. Its fresh acidity and polished tannins promise good aging potential.

Vieux Château Mazerat 2014  Saint-Émilion,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"This powerful ripe wine has firm tannins that are so well integrated.

Benovia 2014 Tilton Hill Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"From an estate vineyard planted high atop the Sebastopol Hills near Freestone, this wine impresses from start to finish.

Château Malartic-Lagravière 2014  Pessac-Léognan,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment.

Heartland 2013 One Red (Langhorne Creek),Red,Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink now–2030.",95,Heartland,Australia,South Australia,Langhorne Creek
Arcadian 2009 Sierra Madre Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases.

Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2014  Pessac-Léognan,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated.

There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone.

Rita Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Extremely alluring aromas of black plum and blackberry meet with touches of caramel, vanilla and fresh rose on the nose of this bottling.

Hall 2013 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate.

Quintessa 2004 Red (Rutherford),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"light, fruity",95,"A dramatic young wine, fleshy and dazzling now for its lush fruit and oak, although the tannins have a crunchy hardness. But that merely ensures ageability. It's beautiful the way the acid-tannin structure plays against the cherry, cassis and olive fruit, creating an architectural tension. If you open this wine now, decant for a few hours. Otherwise, it should hold for six to eight years, and develop further bottle complexity afterward.",125,Quintessa,US,California,Rutherford

Rita Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"The most balanced of Sea Smoke's three new Pinots, Southing was aged in about two-thirds new oak, which gives rich caramel, toasted coconut and exotic spice notes to the ripe fruit flavors.

Château Canon la Gaffelière 2009  Saint-Émilion,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"One of the peculiarities of St.-Émilion's classification is that Canon la Gaffelière is not classed in the top rung.

In a successful year, it rivals Stag's Leap's best wines, including Cask 23, and 2008 was a very successful year. Blended with 2% Merlot, and aged in lots of new French oak, the wine is, in a word, stunning.

It's deep, elegant and penetrating, with a show-stopping layer of pure mineral that is so powerful the fruit seems soaked in rock.",48,Mark Ryan,US,Washington,Red Mountain
Abeja 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Good enough to be a reserve, this includes just 4% Merlot and the rest is all Cabernet.

A companionable wine, already drinking beautifully, but perfectly fine to cellar for up to a decade.",44,Abeja,US,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA)
Diamond Creek 2009 Red Rock Terrace Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"The ripest of Diamond Creek's new '09 Cabernets, Red Rock shows a sun-blasted quality of red currants, blueberry and cassis. Heady and exotic, this is rich in tannins and noble in acidity. While it's a joy to drink now and over the next eight years, its extreme ripeness may limit its longterm ageability.",175,Diamond Creek,US,California,Diamond Mountain District
Domaine Perrot-Minot 2010  Mazoyeres-Chambertin,Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"The small Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru creates structured wines with plenty of texture and tannins.

It will take at least 10 years to start to mature.",475,Domaine Perrot-Minot,France,Burgundy,Mazoyeres-Chambertin
Silverado 2009 Solo Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"In a good vintage, which 2009 was, Silverado's Solo bottling is always worthy of aging. It would be a tragedy to open this 100% Cabernet before 2018, and even then it might be too early. Dry and full bodied, this offers complex blackberry and cassis flavors, with a grounding herbal quality suggestive of sage. The tannins are profound, making the wine tight now.",100,Silverado,US,California,Stags Leap District
Domaine Faiveley 2010  Echézeaux,Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"Very structured and firm, this has the weight, richness and power that is typical of Echézeaux.

It needs at least six years.",225,Domaine Faiveley,France,Burgundy,Echézeaux
Lauren Ashton Cellars 2009 Cuvée Arlette Red (Red Mountain),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,other,95,"This is a stunning Bordeaux-style blend of 57% Merlot, 19% Cabernet Franc and 9% Cabernet Sauvignon, with 2.5% each of Petit Verdot and Malbec.

Château Trotanoy 2005  Pomerol,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",96,"Certainly it is firm, with impressive power. But the smoothness of the ripe black fruits as they combine with the beautifully judged wood show a contrast of tension with the dense, chewy core. At its heart, this wine is dark and solid and concentrated, promising long aging.",250,Château Trotanoy,France,Bordeaux,Pomerol
Château Lynch-Bages 2005  Pauillac,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Classic Lynch-Bages with just a bit of extra power and richness. While the tannins are structured, it is the velvety fruit that rolls around the mouth that is the most dominant character. It is coming together into a wine that will be big and dense, but never over the top.",115,Château Lynch-Bages,France,Bordeaux,Pauillac
Le Dôme 2005  Saint-Émilion,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"light, fruity",95,"An aristocratic, perfumed wine dominated by delicious Cabernet Franc. Beneath this elegant exterior, there is also power from intensely concentrated fruit and tannins. The wine is already well integrated, the wood only here by feel, balancing so well with the fruit. To finish, sweet fruit and dusty tannins combine easily.",276,Le Dôme,France,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion
Barnett 2005 Rattlesnake Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Rattlesnake Hill is on the estate, more than 2,000 feet up in the Mayacamas above St. Helena. Typically tannic, in the way of Spring Mountain Cabs, the '05 is a dramatically structured wine that dazzles with power. Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows classic varietal flavors of black currants, cherries, licorice and spices, while mostly new French oak adds the perfect facade of smoky wood. Fabulous now with decanting and over rich fare such as steak, the wine should age gracefully for at least a decade.",120,Barnett,US,California,Spring Mountain District
Piña 2005 Buckeye Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Howell Mountain has been the source of Piña's best Cabs, and this single-vineyard bottling shows stunning concentration and complexity. It's closed and tannic now, in the manner of Howell Mountain Cabs, but enormous in ripe black currant fruit, with the power and focus to age for many years. Best after 2009 and through 2017, but only with impeccable cellar conditions.",78,Piña,US,California,Howell Mountain
Château Branaire-Ducru 2005  Saint-Julien,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is opulent, but with restraint. The fruit is rich, black and delicious.

Château Hosanna 2005  Pomerol,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"Everything is here in this great wine. The solid fruit flavors are of black berries and dried raisins, and there is a rich, powerful structure. Above all, it is finely balanced.

Kendall-Jackson 2003 Stature Red (Napa Valley),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards.

Jasper Hill 2012 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote),Red,Shiraz,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"When the alcohol levels are reined in to appropriate levels, this can be one of Australia's top Shiraz. The 2012 is a stunning example of balance and finesse, combining youthful scents of cassis and toasty oak with floral elements. There's ample weight and texture yet silky elegance at the same time, while already complex notes of orange pekoe and black currant are sure to gain even more with five or 10 years of cellaring.

Mark Ryan 2011 Wild Eyed Syrah (Red Mountain),Red,Syrah,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Force Majeure and Ciel du Cheval are the sources for this pure, compelling Red Mountain Syrah. The complex aromatics shoot up a smorgasbord of cured meat, truffle and umami notes, leading into a crisp, racy palate with lovely blueberry-dominated fruit flavors. Aging in 500-liter puncheons smoothes it out while contributing just a hint of new toast.",48,Mark Ryan,US,Washington,Red Mountain
Betz Family 2011 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Intriguing scents focus upon chamomile and Mediterranean herbs, while the fruit flavors are wild and brambly.

Coomber Family Ranch 2010 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"There's good structure to this Cabernet, thanks to the firm tannins and ample acidity. But the flavors take the starring role, with raspberries, cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. It has a light, delicate mouthfeel, although there's nothing light about the taste. It's complex and ageable, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around.",126,Coomber Family Ranch,US,California,Rutherford
Williams Selyem 2012 Olivet Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,other,95,"Dry, tart and balanced, it has keen acidity highlighting complex flavors of pomegranates, persimmons, cherries and sandalwood, with the earthy, plummy sweetness of mu shu sauce.

JM Cellars 2011 Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),Red,Merlot,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is the winery's first single-vineyard Merlot.

Krupp Brothers 2010 M5 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Grown in one of the valley's best vineyards, it's eminently ageable. The flavors of black currants and minerals are intense and fine, complexed with new French oak. However, the strong tannins will jacket the wine for a long time before they begin to fall out.

Maison Bleue 2011 Boushey Vineyard Le Midi Grenache (Yakima Valley),Red,Grenache,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This was fermented with 50% whole clusters, which slows down and evens up the process.

Oakville East 2010 Core Stone Red (Oakville),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this shows hard tannins and dryness despite the intensely ripe blackberries and cherries at its core.

Penfolds 2008 Grange Shiraz (South Australia),Red,Shiraz,"medium bodied, balanced",98,"This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest.

In some vintages, like this one, the combination is incredibly sumptuous, offering layers of blueberry and blackberry fruit intermingled elegantly with hints of French vanilla.

Williams Selyem 2011 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"One sip is all it takes to be blown away by this Pinot's beauty. It's exquisitely crafted, a testament to both the vineyard and the winery's oenological talent.

Flowers 2011 Sea View Ridge Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"The most notable thing about this Pinot is its intensity of flavor.

Château Pichon Longueville 2011  Pauillac,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is a solid, concentrated wine from a reliable chateau.

Colomé 2010 Reserva Malbec (Salta),Red,Malbec,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Take note, this could be the best wine Colomé has ever bottled. Cedary oak aromas grace ripe, almost desiccated wild berry notes that are slightly herbal and sauvage. A well-layered mouthfeel is ideal in power and precision.

Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc highlight the beauty of Tuscany and portray the region in terms of thick chocolate fudge, succulent cherry and currant, exotic spice and vanilla seed.

Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine.

The wine will be at its best after 2018.",215,Gaja,Italy,Piedmont,Langhe
Black Coyote 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"Tasted blind in a large group of Napa Valley Cabernets, this one stood out for sheer power and authority. It's absolutely delicious, dazzling showing blackberry tart, cherry pie with the sweet, smoky crust, cassis and baking spice flavors, wrapped into wonderfully thick, fine tannins. Pure California fruit, but dry, balanced and nuanced. A classic, but high-alcohol haters will find plenty to complain about. Drink now–2020.",85,Black Coyote,US,California,Atlas Peak
Gaja 2006 Costa Russi Nebbiolo (Langhe),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Purchased by the Gaja family in 1967, the Costa Russi vineyard produces elegant expressions of Nebbiolo with beautifully saturated, sun-drenched flavors. Indeed, this vintage shows wild berry with beautiful background renderings of smoke and graphite. Five percent Barbera is added and the wine shows amazing harmony and sophistication with bright acidity and firm tannins. It will only become more beautiful in time.",420,Gaja,Italy,Piedmont,Langhe
Testarossa 2009 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"So delicious, so dazzlingly seductive, it's impossible not to fall in love with this wine. It detonates on the palate with an explosion of cherries and raspberries, and wonderfully smoky, buttery complexities from oak. Drily crisp and finely structured in smooth, dense tannins, it offers great pleasure now, and should develop over the next 6–8 years. Production was low, but it's worth a search.",56,Testarossa,US,California,Santa Lucia Highlands
Charnu 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"Classic Napa Cabernet, with perfectly ripened blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit, nicely elaborated by sweet, smoky oak, and framed in ripe, smooth tannins. Really a lovely wine, with the balanced equilibrium to ride out the next decade.",75,Charnu,US,California,St. Helena
Freemark Abbey 2006 Bosche Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Very rich, ripe and complex, showing a near-perfect display of flavors and textures. The riper blackberries and black cherries have a chewy, meaty edge, with notes of cola and bacon. Very fine tannins and acidity suggest midterm to longterm aging, but it's a splendid sipper now. Should develop through 2018, at least.",70,Freemark Abbey,US,California,Rutherford
Krutz 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse. The refined essence of blackberries, black currants and spices thrills the palate, accented with the most beautiful coating of smoky oak. A great achievement that should develop in the bottle through 2018.",70,Krutz,US,California,Napa Valley
Continuum 2007 Red (Napa Valley),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"light, fruity",97,"Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",140,Continuum,US,California,Napa Valley
Bodega Catena Zapata 2006 Nicasia Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),Red,Malbec,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.",120,Bodega Catena Zapata,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mendoza
Kathryn Kennedy 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",97,"A thoroughly elegant, serious and yet immensely enjoyable wine that stays lively many days after opening, this bottling from a regional icon shows dried violets, dried strawberry, crushed pepper and touches of leather and soy on the wondrous nose. Lithe black plum and elderberry fruits ride along a tight but forgiving tannic structure, with support from crushed gravel, asphalt, potpourri, sandalwood and cedar flavors.",100,Kathryn Kennedy,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountains
Massolino 2010 Vigna Rionda Riserva  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"This stunning wine opens with scents of tilled earth, leather, pipe tobacco, forest floor and wild berry. The focused, vibrant palate delivers ripe red cherry, white pepper, grilled herb, licorice and an energizing mineral note. Youthfully austere, refined tannins and fresh acidity provide impeccable balance and an impressive, ageworthy structure. Drink 2020–2045.",150,Massolino,Italy,Piedmont,Barolo
Patrimony 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaida District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"Extremely dark in the glass, this tremendous effort by the Daou brothers was nine years in the making, and it shows. Dense aromas of crushed lilacs, chocolate chips, soy and dark purple fruits come through with power on the nose. The palate is soft and supple in structure, offering flavors of blueberry, cocoa, pepper, graphite and candied fruit. The tannins remain a tad sticky, so drink 2018–2033.",275,Patrimony,US,California,Adelaida District
Rivetto 2010 Briccolina Riserva  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"light, fruity",96,"This gorgeous wine opens with scents of ripe, dark-skinned berry, cake spice, star anise and a balsamic note. The delicious palate tastes of layers of juicy raspberry, black cherry, licorice and a hint of tobacco framed in firm refined tannins. It already shows impressive depth but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2030.",210,Rivetto,Italy,Piedmont,Barolo
Crown Point 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"Entrepreneur Roger Bower hired Harlan Estate alum Adam Henkel to deliver top-tier wines, and this first release is an extremely auspicious beginning. Black as night in the glass, the wine delivers elegant aromas of olallieberry jam, baking spice, shaved chocolate, beef jerky, teriyaki and purple flowers. The sticky structure will age phenomenally, further concentrating flavors of coffee foam, soy-laced berry sauce, Asian pepper spice, and dense blueberry, black cassis and black plum fruit. Drink 2018–2033.",185,Crown Point,US,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara
Calera 2013 Mills Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"A fascinating feral quality wraps around this wine, redolent of mottled animal hair, raw meat and scraped earth, like the scene of a freshly hunted wild boar. Aromas of mulberry and dark strawberry also show on the nose, while the palate dives deep into turned earth, shiitake mushrooms, juniper, stewed bay leaf, wild cherry and elderflower liqueur. The acidity also pops and the texture grips firmly.",62,Calera,US,California,Mt. Harlan
Mount Eden Vineyards 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This wine is wound extremely tight, but opens like a lotus with decanting or overnight patience. Aromas of rose buds, black-raspberry extract, wet clay and dried purple flowers show on the nose, bolstered by the slightest smoky kiss of oak. Savory flavors of roasted black-plum skins and elderberry meet with soy, graphite and loam on the palate, which will gain amazing tertiary flavors with time. Drink 2018–2028.",62,Mount Eden Vineyards,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountains
Broadside 2013 Ephemera Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"Brian and Stephy Terrizzi have added this luxury-level bottling to their more affordably focused brand of wines, and it's an impressive addition. A deep and dense nose unleashes blackberries, licorice, crushed volcanic rocks, sexy dark chocolate, violet and black spice.

Calera 2013 Selleck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"Fragrant lilacs and plump mulberries mix with black clove, allspice, pine needles and dark earth tones on this bottling by Josh Jensen from this 4.8-acre vineyard. The palate presents hearty sagebrush spice and an easily enjoyable character of black cherry that lead into the more complex pine sap, bay leaf, wild thyme and euclalytpus components.",95,Calera,US,California,Mt. Harlan
Gainey 2012 Patrick's Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is the Gainey family's annual statement on how Bordeaux varieties can excel in the Santa Ynez Valley, and this blend of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot and 2% Merlot is a marvelous argument. Aromas of pepper, pencil shavings, oregano, dill, elderberries, black currant and dried blueberries lead into an expertly integrated palate where black fruit is nuanced by cedar, dried oregano, crushed gravel and peppery spice.",60,Gainey,US,California,Santa Ynez Valley
Quady 2006 Starboard Dessert Wine Port (Amador County),Red,Port,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Power and grace combine in this great fortified wine. Already 10 years old, it will age gracefully through at least 2030 if kept in a cool cellar. The aromas combine ripe, vivid cherry and blackberry with caramel accents. Flavors are very ripe but tangy at the same time, echoing plum jam and toffee on the finish.",34,Quady,US,California,Amador County
Travaglini 2010 Riserva  (Gattinara),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Elegant and structured, this opens with exquisite scents of cedar, chopped herb, pressed rose, menthol and perfumed berry. The luminous palate is loaded with finesse, delivering bright red cherry, chopped red raspberry, licorice, clove and mineral.

Mount Eden Vineyards 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Extremely elegant and restrained at first on the nose, this bottling eventually shows gravel and crushed rocks, with hints of blackberry and forest underbrush also emerging. A very firm structure weaves together an incredibly well-integrated wine, with dense mulberry and dried-fennel notes that morph into crushed herbs with time. Drink 2018–2032.",70,Mount Eden Vineyards,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountains
Staglin 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"light, fruity",96,"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least.",175,Staglin,US,California,Rutherford
Massolino 2006 Parafada  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Massolino's Parafada Barolo is a stunningly beautiful wine with bold, confident aromas of black fruit, tobacco, cigar box, cherry cola, clove, nutmeg and vanilla bean. The mouthfeel is bright, lively, velvety and, generally speaking, the 2006 vintage represents a big jump over 2005.",94,Massolino,Italy,Piedmont,Barolo
Vietti 2006 Rocche  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Rocche Barolo is another homerun for Vietti. You'll fall in love with the wine's rich intensity and the ensuing complexity that becomes apparent as the wine spends more time in the glass. Thanks to a continuing evolution, you'll recognize aromas of wild berry, smoke, crushed stone, licorice, cola and mesquite. The tannins are silky and smooth. Hold ten years or more.",130,Vietti,Italy,Piedmont,Barolo
Ceretto 2005 Bricco Rocche Bricco Rocche  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Nebbiolo grapes, with their naturally elegant aromas of black currant and licorice, speak loudly. So does winery magic: Tones of spice, leather, cola and tobacco are derived from 24 months of careful oak aging. The tannins are fine and tight and this wine will age ten years or more.",252,Ceretto,Italy,Piedmont,Barolo
Gainey 2008 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"An absolutely lovely Pinot, the best in Gainey's long career. Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity. The oak treatment is tasteful and blends in seamlessly, offering a hint of toast. The wine treads an exciting line between ripeness and earthiness, while keeping alcohol to a refreshingly low 14.1%. This is a connoisseur's wine.",48,Gainey,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Etude 2007 Deer Camp Pinot Noir (Carneros),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This has been one of Etude's best bottlings, and 2007 was a great year. If you enjoy sheer, decadent deliciousness in your Pinot Noirs, this is one for you. The palate first is struck by the rich waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry essence and sweet, vanilla-tinged, smoky oak. Then it discovers the soft silkiness, and finally the firm, fine tannins kick in, providing structure. Just beguiling, and should develop in the bottle over the next 5–6 years.",60,Etude,US,California,Carneros
Doubleback 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This eagerly anticipated Drew Bledsoe/Chris Figgins collaboration is a serious effort, dusty, dense, and dark. To begin are whiffs of cinnamon, smoke, cured meat and bacon; then come tight, dry, stone-soaked flavors of cassis and sweet black fruits. Floral highlights elevate the nose, and lead into a finish with delicious accents of toasted nuts, almond paste, and chalk. A dazzling debut.",82,Doubleback,US,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Eugenio Bocchino 2006 La Serra  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"From a simpatico, family-run winery comes this benchmark Barolo. La Serra speaks highly of the Langhe territory and of winemaking innovation. Aromas here include cherry cola, vanilla bean, leather and crushed granite stone. The wine is determined and direct with a savory note of cured meat on the long finish. Drink after 2017.",100,Eugenio Bocchino,Italy,Piedmont,Barolo
Von Strasser 2008 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",98,"As good as the winery's other 2008s are, this wine raises the stakes. It's bone dry, deeply tannic and marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, with sweet, smoky oak. Almost a food group in itself for its complexity, it's dazzling now for its sheer luxurious deliciousness, yet is guaranteed to develop over at least the next 10 years.",125,Von Strasser,US,California,Diamond Mountain District
Cayuse 2008 En Cerise Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Syrah,"medium bodied, balanced",98,"A subtle, complex, utterly distinctive mix of flavors, with opening streaks of butter cookie, then mushroom broth, tightly wound berry fruit, earthy coffee grounds and even darker streaks of espresso and smoke and licorice. It is deeply layered with flavors that just keep piling on. Amazing wine.",70,Cayuse,US,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Merryvale 2008 Profile Red (Napa Valley),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"A tremendous wine that shows how Merryvale is absolutely at the top of its game. Impeccable in structure, with refined tannins that are soft and firm at the same time, and a fine cut of acidity. Entirely dry, the Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is awesome in blackberry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, with complexities of anise, soy sauce, grilled meats and minerals. Beyond the particulars, it just feels dramatic and rich in the mouth. A great wine that should develop in the bottle over the next decade.",165,Merryvale,US,California,Napa Valley
Cayuse 2008 Cailloux Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Syrah,"full bodied, robust",97,"This is the only Cayuse Syrah that is co-fermented (with 8% Viognier), which adds nuances of white flower and floral, though the citrus rind scents override them. In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions. Mineral, berry, mountain complexity, nuanced herb and earth and citrus, all in proportion, and all flowing in the mouth.",70,Cayuse,US,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Penfolds 2004 Grange Shiraz (South Australia),Red,Shiraz,"full bodied, robust",96,"A throwback to the monster Shiraz style of old, with loads of toasty, vanilla-laden oak, meaty nuances and driving, intense boysenberry fruit, the 2004 Grange should prove tremendously long-lived. Its massive concentration and firm tannins suggest cellaring through 2020, after which it should drink well for at least another decade or two.",500,Penfolds,Australia,South Australia,South Australia
Moone-Tsai 2008 Cor Leonis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"The question concerning this wine isn't whether or not it's very good—it is. Instead, it's about ageability. Made from 100% Cabernet grown in two very different places, Pritchard Hill and Coombsville, it's dry and refined. Floods the mouth with blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, spice and new oak flavors whose richness is tempered by a firm minerality. Really fabulous in all respects, but so delicious now, it makes you wonder why you should even risk more than six years in the cellar.",175,Moone-Tsai,US,California,Napa Valley
Vineyard 7&8 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"It's hard to exaggerate the purity of this wine, which is 100% Cabernet. It startles for the intensity of mountain blackberries and raspberries, and then a firm minerality kicks in, along with the tannins, providing grounding structure. The finish lasts for a full minute. Winemaker Luc Morlet has really hit the jackpot with this dry, spectacularly complex young wine, which will develop for at least a decade.",125,Vineyard 7&8,US,California,Spring Mountain District
Sequoia Grove 2007 Rutherford Bench Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"A stunningly beautiful Cabernet, made from the estate vineyard of all five classic Bordeaux varieties. Softly tannic and dry, it shows lush flavors of green olives, black cherries, anise and smoky oak that swirl into a long, impressive finish. Drinkable now for sheer beauty, it will develop over the next decade.",65,Sequoia Grove,US,California,Rutherford
Cayuse 2008 En Chamberlin Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Syrah,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"A huge wine, fat with the characteristic Cayuse funk, and accented with plenty of meaty asphalt. Potent and powerful, bursting with berries and plums, scented with the aromas of earth and sweet (not dried) herb, chicken stock and flavors that run through the same exotic range. Round and full, forward and balanced, drinking well and maybe just a bit rounder than its brethren.",70,Cayuse,US,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Cayuse 2008 Widowmaker Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Superb sculpture and definition in this compact and lightly funky evocation of pure Cabernet Sauvignon. The deep, dense, super ripe berry flavors are framed within a bouquet of dried herbs, pepper, mineral, astringent tannins, and a crisp mix of earth, wood and plant flavors. Superb length and ageability.",70,Cayuse,US,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Januik 2008 Reserve Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,other,95,"Januik's reserve is a blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, and 2% Cabernet Franc. Sourced from Champoux and Weinbau, just three barrels were made. The fruit is deeply flavored with black cherry and cassis, and the tannins seem darker, earthier, toastier and overall fuller than any of the other excellent Januik reds. Still young and tight, this promises to blossom over time with floral, earth, barrel and spice highlights.",65,Januik,US,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA)
D.R. Stephens 2008 Moose Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Here's one of the most ageworthy wines of the vintage. A 100% Cabernet, its grapes come from a vineyard in eastern St. Helena, off the Silverado Trail. Cab's usual blackberries and cassis are there, along with classic elements of green olives and herbs, with a funkiness that adds an umami tang. Very finely constructed, very complex, spicy and delicious. Give it six years, at least.",125,D.R. Stephens,US,California,Napa Valley
Adelsheim 2009 Nicholas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"The best of a great flight of single-vineyard 2009 Pinots from Adelsheim, this new entry into the lineup is all muscle and black fruits. It is power-packed with dense, rich flavors, nuanced with exotic spices and black tea, moving into silky tannins and an extremely long, satisfying finish.",90,Adelsheim,US,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains
Maybach 2008 Weitz Vineyard Materium Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"A powerful, concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon. Impressive for the sheer density of fruit, namely blackberries, cherries and chocolate, accented with buttery, caramelized new oak perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. The tannins are soft, sweet and intricate. Despite the richness, There's a firm minerality that adds to the structure and grounds it. So opulently delicious, you could drink it now, and it should develop in the bottle over the next six years, at least.",125,Maybach,US,California,Oakville
Merryvale 2008 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Franc,"full bodied, robust",95,"A rare Cabernet Franc from Merry-vale, and a spectacular one. They've handled this finicky variety just right, although surely the addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec adds weight and tone. The wine is dry, richly tannic and enormously flavorful, offering waves of cherries, red currants, red licorice, cola, sweet cedar wood and even savory hints of bacon. A tremendous Cabernet Franc that will stand as a definitive version in California.",90,Merryvale,US,California,Napa Valley
Moone-Tsai 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this Cabernet, which contains a little Merlot. It's rich and lush and authoritative on every level. The texture is soft as velvet, but the tannins are firm, backing up blackberry, cherry, chocolate, cassis, mineral and new oak flavors that are complex and linger long into the spicy finish. Such are the tannins that the wine is likely to age well through 2016, at least.",75,Moone-Tsai,US,California,Napa Valley
L'Ecole No. 41 2008 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"From the oldest block of the estate's Seven Hills Vineyard, this pure Cabernet opens with intense aromas of mountain fruit.

Charles Smith 2008 Royal City Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red,Syrah,"full bodied, robust",98,"An Amaro-like mix of bitters and herbs; this is exceptionally dense and dark. The fruit is a grace note; the big flavors come from herb, earth, rock, barrel and more. Licorice, baking spices, smoke, black cherry, Bourbon barrel, and on it goes. Huge and dense and seemingly endless.",140,Charles Smith,US,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA)
Conn Creek 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",96,"A tremendous Cabernet, showing the authority of its vineyard, high up in the Vaca Mountains. Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value.",45,Conn Creek,US,California,Atlas Peak
K Vintners 2008 The Creator Red (Washington),Red,Red Blend,other,95,"This edition of The Creator is a one-time only mix of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon from Stoneridge, 21% Cabernet from Cailloux, and 36% Syrah from Morrison Lane. It's edgy and tight, with sharply defined corners—herbal, with a leafy/stemmy note, well-integrated into wild, brambly berry fruits. The 50% new oak is virtually invisible at this point; it fills out the mouthfeel but does not show specifically.",55,K Vintners,US,Washington,Washington
Duckhorn 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"A tremendous Cabernet, one of the last to come from the great 2007 vintage. Drinking perfectly now, it's a soft, smooth sipper, with lush flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar. The addition of Merlot brings a soft, mellowed mouthfeel. Picking up bottle bouquet at the age of four, it will continue to gain traction for many years.",65,Duckhorn,US,California,Napa Valley
Ravenswood 2008 Old Hill Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),Red,Zinfandel,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"A tremendous Zinfandel, Ravenswood's most expensive, and while you might quiver at the price, it's easily a very great wine. This is Zinfandel on steroids, a monster of wild summer berry, tobacco, currant and spice flavors, wrapped into significantly thick tannins. Yet despite the power, it never quite loses elegance and balance. The winery's 2007 was their greatest Zinfandel ever, and this one isn't far behind.",60,Ravenswood,US,California,Sonoma Valley
Yao Ming 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.",625,Yao Ming,US,California,Napa Valley
De Loach 2009 Pennacchio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"With the 2009 vintage, De Loach is at the top of its Pinot Noir game, and this one, from a chilly vineyard south of Sebastopol, is among its best ever. The crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime, that accompanies the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit is bracing. Meanwhile, a mushroomy earthiness gives complex layers that don't stop. It should age through the next decade.",45,De Loach,US,California,Russian River Valley
Venge 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul.",135,Venge,US,California,Napa Valley
St. Supéry 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"This rich wine is a great success. It's enormously rich, almost flamboyant in blackberry jam, blueberry cobbler, anise and smoky new oak, as delicious as any Cabernet out there. Yet it shows a fine structure and relatively modest alcohol, a feature of the 2008 vintage. Good as it is now, you can safely cellar it for the rest of this decade and watch it evolve.",85,St. Supéry,US,California,Rutherford
Yao Ming 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It shows a dramatic structure marked particularly by firm, smooth tannins, and it finishes dry. Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting.",170,Yao Ming,US,California,Napa Valley
Giacomo Fenocchio 2013 Castellero  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"full bodied, robust",95,"Woodland berry, new leather, dark baking spice and rose aromas are front and center on this radiant red. It's well structured and loaded with finesse, delivering morello cherry, wild strawberry, clove and star anise framed in firm refined tannins and vibrant acidity. Young and balanced, it will be even better with more bottle age. Drink 2023–2043.",55,Giacomo Fenocchio,Italy,Piedmont,Barolo
Renato Ratti 2013 Marcenasco  (Barolo),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Wild berry, crushed herb, violet and baking spice scents lift out of the glass along with a whiff of menthol.

Baking spices and plummy fruit form a concentrated, nearly impenetrable wall on the nose, while the palate is nearly dense enough to stand a fork in.

García Figuero 2011 Tinus  (Ribera del Duero),Red,Tempranillo,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents.

Moss Wood 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"light, fruity",95,"Perhaps the best young wine I've tasted from Margaret River, this makes a compelling case for the region's Cabernet.

It shows the hard tannins that always mark the winery's Bordeaux-style red wines, but it's luscious and deep in berry fruit, licorice, grilled meat and cola.

Marimar Estate 2008 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness. So delicious now, it's hard to resist, but the wise collector will cellar it for 4–5 years, maybe even longer.",49,Marimar Estate,US,California,Russian River Valley
Sanford 2009 La Rinconada Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"There's a grace and purity to this Pinot Noir that make it particularly recommendable. It's so light and silky, it just glides like a butterfly across the palate. But it's extraordinarily rich in wild raspberry and cherry fruit, and the white pepper and baking spices make it savory. Delicious now, but it should prosper over the next eight years, at least.",60,Sanford,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Trapiche 2009 Finca Jorge Miralles Single Vineyard Malbec (La Consulta),Red,Malbec,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is a real blaster of a Malbec, showing power, concentration and subtleties. The bouquet is full of graham cracker, cola, monster berry and moss notes, while the pure, driving palate deals flavors of toasty blackberry, spice, mocha and more. The lengthy but mellow finish hums like a fine-tuned machine. Drink now–2018.",50,Trapiche,Argentina,Mendoza Province,La Consulta
Von Strasser 2009 Spaulding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"This has so much rich earth and minerality, it's like a journey deep into a mine. It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast. Tannic and tight in the way of Diamond Mountain Cabernets, this should begin to come into its own after 2016.",80,Von Strasser,US,California,Diamond Mountain District
La Sirena 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"You will want to age this Cabernet—8 or 10 years of development is the only way to allow the hard tannins to begin to melt away, allowing the fabulous core of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate to emerge. It's hard to exaggerate the wine's depth; it's so elegantly pure, concentrated and focused. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018, and it could still be providing pleasure 20 years from now.",150,La Sirena,US,California,Napa Valley
Furthermore 2009 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Showing lovely silkiness, dryness and transparency, this is a Pinot to drink now or age for a while. The flavors are rich but elusive, suggesting wild summer raspberries, cola, pine needles and sautéed mushrooms splashed with balsamic, with the sweet smokiness of oak barrel aging. It's delicate and powerful, but only 47 cases were produced.",50,Furthermore,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Von Strasser 2009 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards. Give it at least eight years, and it could be drinking well 20 years from now.",80,Von Strasser,US,California,Diamond Mountain District
Roche de Bellene 2012  Charmes-Chambertin,Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"As always with a grand cru from Gevrey-Chambertin, this wine shows immense power.

The vibrant palate boasts wonderful intensity, weaving notes of white pepper, baking spice, savory herb, licorice and mineral around a black cherry core.

Equal parts pretty and funky, it's a tightly wound, savory, fruity wine that's elegant and compelling.

Moore Vineyard Zinfandel (Coombsville),Red,Zinfandel,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"From a vineyard east of Napa first planted in 1905, Moore is densely structured and deceptively elegant, all while maintaining an intensity of tart cherry and wild blackberry.

It's made using grapes that are sourced from at least six vineyards scattered from Yountville to St. Helena.

Moone-Tsai 2009 Cor Leonis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"This wine is entirely Cabernet, using grapes from the southerly Coombsville area and warmer St. Helena. As such, it's wonderfully balanced, with a sprightly burst of acidity brightening succulent flavors of black cherry and dark chocolate.

True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated.

Cascading flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are drenched in caramel, mocha and buttery barrel flavors. Although the wine lists at a hefty 14.9% alcohol, it does not sacrifice elegance, nor does it substitute power for polish.

Williams Selyem 2014 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"From an organic, dry farmed vineyard, this wine is as feral as the forest—a study in wild boar, wildflowers and dried herbs.

Penfolds 2014 Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones.

Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation. This cuvée is the best of the collection, with its brooding, opaque character, suggesting rather than revealing power at this stage.

He is continuing the family tradition of making powerful statements of Syrah from Hermitage, combining massive structure and over-powering perfumes.

Guigal 1998 La Turque  (Côte Rôtie),Red,Rhône-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"A firm, dry, foursquare wine that has power and structure rather than the immediate perfumes of La Mouline, the partner cuvée from Guigal. This is the wine for those who want power with big tannins, and they don't come more powerful or tannic than this.

E. Guigal 1999  Hermitage,Red,Rhône-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"A massive wine, with its opaque, dense purple color, its huge tannins and its tight, powerful structure. When it develops—maybe in 10 or 15 years' time—the perfumed, juicy Syrah fruits that are just suggested for the moment are going to be as dominant as the tannins are now.

Andrew Will 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),Red,Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus. The wine seems almost crystalline—sharp-edged and reflective, with penetrating angles and offset flavors.",53,Andrew Will,US,Washington,Red Mountain
Rulo 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red,Syrah,"light, fruity",96,"Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings.

This is a delicious wine that you will enjoy on every level. The intensity and purity of the fruit and spice aromas are impressive and the mouthfeel is extra-plush and supple. Yet, those firm tannins give it the balance and structure it needs.",120,Le Chiuse,Italy,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino
Andrew Will 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),Red,Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk.

Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.",53,Andrew Will,US,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills
Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char.

Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases).

The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a cool area south of the Russian River Valley, toward San Francisco. The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, sautéed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don't go together, just try the wine. It's seamless and compelling. Drink now–2020.",55,Williams Selyem,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Von Strasser 2010 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is a 40-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with the balance consisting of Merlot. It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak. Yet it's not oaky at all, with the wood bringing only additional sweet, smoky richness to the red currants, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. This is a superb wine, delicious right out of the bottle, but it should develop and, depending on your tastes, improve over the next 20 years.",135,Von Strasser,US,California,Diamond Mountain District

It's lush, ripe and amazingly generous in raspberries and cherries, yet retains an elegant balance, as well as fine, mouthwatering acidity. Part of the attraction is low alcohol, which lets the stones and earthy complexities of the wine shine through. This is really a brilliant wine—light, delicate and powerful. If you want to age it for eight years or so, you won't be sorry.",45,Failla,US,California,Russian River Valley
Doubleback 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins.

Perfect tannins, as pure as velvet and sweet, and perfect oak, too, with beautifully applied char and wood spice. That the oak is 100% new is in keeping with the wine's volumetrics. The wine's flavors are a profound, heady expression of blackberries, blueberries, cassis and dark, barely sweetened chocolate. Just spectacular, a real achievement by any world class standard. Production was a scant 275 cases.",125,Venge,US,California,Oakville
Château Latour 2011  Pauillac,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",97,"Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later.",660,Château Latour,France,Bordeaux,Pauillac

Tenuta San Guido 2010 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia),Red,Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"This supremely elegant and age-worthy Sassicaia opens with an intense bouquet of black cherry, Mediterranean herbs, blue flower, cedar and leather aromas. Powerful but graceful, the palate delivers a vibrant core of black cherry accented with white pepper, mineral and balsamic notes alongside youthful but polished tannins and vibrant acidity.

Trefethen 2008 HaLo Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Trefethen has been on a roll the last few years, producing some of Napa's most spectacular Cabernets. This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years.

It's perfumed with notes of green olive, violets, dried herbs, mineral and smoked meat.

It's quite a ride.",65,Pali,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Hall 2013 Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"This is a blockbuster of a wine, powerfully built grape by grape, with just a handful of Merlot. Cherry vanilla, leathery cedar and juicy plum combine around a lush, voluptuous mouthfeel of tension and tannin.

Lancaster 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"A massive wine that absolutely demands time in the cellar, Lancaster's '05 is nearly all Cabernet, with tiny amounts of the other four Bordeaux varieties. It stuns with the power and authenticity of its hilly Cabernet origins, offering vast black currant, orange rind, anise and smoky oak flavors that implode on the palate. But the tannins are hard. It should blossom and fully come into its own after 2010.",70,Lancaster,US,California,Alexander Valley

Renteria 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"This remarkable Cabernet was grown and produced by a longtime Mexican-American immigrant. It is an extraordinary wine, rich and full-bodied, explosive in sweetly ripe blackberries, cherries and black currants, yet given firmness by a firm minerality that must come from the soil.

Domaine Jayer-Gilles 2006 Echézeaux du Dessus  (Echézeaux),Red,Pinot Noir,"light, fruity",95,"Here is an ageworthy wine, a proper grand cru. The spice from the wood is the dominant factor to begin with, and this needs more time to integrate. But already, the fruit is impressively ripe and jammy, a fruit salad of black and red berry fruits. The tannins are dark, brooding away in the background. Keep this wine at least five years, probably 10.",300,Domaine Jayer-Gilles,France,Burgundy,Echézeaux

The tannins are obvious, but sweetly ripe and soft. A brilliant evocation of Napa Cabernet, despite a high production level of nearly 30,000 cases, which is about the same size as a Bordeaux first growth.

Merry Edwards 2011 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"What's so wonderful about this Pinot is the way it reconciles all sorts of opposites. It's dry but sweet in fruit, and delicate yet potent at the same time. It's totally accessible now, but enormously complex.

Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying.

Verité 2007 La Muse Red (Sonoma County),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",100,"This wine dazzles with perfection. Sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, it refutes the belief that a great Cabernet must come from a single vineyard. It does not. The master's art of blending, coupled with demanding vineyard practices lends completeness. The blend is 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, making it an extraordinary success despite the absence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Give credit to winemaker Pierre Seillan. The wine itself is absolutely dry. It starts with a tug of tannins, baring flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and new oak, with earthy, herbal and meaty complexities.

Mt. Brave 2008 Merlot (Mount Veeder),Red,Merlot,"full bodied, robust",98,"A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months.",60,Mt. Brave,US,California,Mount Veeder
Verité 2008 Le Desir Red (Sonoma County),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",97,"The 2008 vintage presented challenges for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this Cabernet Franc-based blend succeeds wildly. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, with flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, licorice and spicy cola. Ninety-five percent new oak lends this a wonderful toastiness. Few wines could handle that much new wood, but this one can. However, it's very tannic. You can drink it now, but it should blossom after 2014.",450,Verité,US,California,Sonoma County

The winemaker, Ted Henry, also is at the helm of Jarvis. This young Cabernet should develop over the next dozen years, at least, in a good cellar.",55,Prime,US,California,Napa Valley
Talley 2009 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Sheer opulence is the hallmark of this wine. Call it feminine in its soft silkiness, and the way the raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors caress the palate. Yet there's a firmness of structure, a stony, minerally quality that lends power and authority. Great now, and will develop in the bottle for the next 6–8 years.",58,Talley,US,California,Arroyo Grande Valley
Talley 2009 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"A great Pinot Noir, although it's rugged now in its youth, with a scoury mouthfeel. Raspberries, cherries, cola, mushrooms splashed with balsamic, and white pepper, clove and cinnamon spices mark the flavors. Should emerge from austerity by 2015 and provide good drinking for several years afterward.",70,Talley,US,California,Arroyo Grande Valley
Il Marroneto 2012 Madonna delle Grazie  (Brunello di Montalcino),Red,Sangiovese,"light, fruity",99,"Perfumed berry, rose, new leather and dark spice are some of the enticing scents you'll find in this vibrant wine. It's still tightly wound but already dazzles with juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg and pipe tobacco flavors. Youthfully austere but noble tannins and bright acidity provide balance and serious aging potential. Don't be tempted to open it soon—the best is yet to come.

Conti Costanti 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,Red,Sangiovese,"medium bodied, balanced",98,"Immensely inviting, this opens with fragrant pipe tobacco, crushed berry, new leather and pressed violet aromas. On the palate, firm, refined tannins underpin juicy black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon flavors, while orange zest accents and an energizing mineral note lift the finish.

Torbreck 2013 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Red,Shiraz,"light, fruity",98,"Full-bodied and plush yet vibrant and imbued with fresh fruit, this is simply superb. The oak is present but never dominant, adding brown sugar and cinnamon elements to blueberry, roasted meat, espresso and black olive notes. A hint of peppery spice also creeps into this impossibly complex wine. The finish combines power, length, freshness and dusty tannins, suggesting that while impressive now, it should age well. Drink now–2030.",125,Torbreck,Australia,South Australia,Barossa Valley

Château Cos d'Estournel 2014  Saint-Estèphe,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"This is an immensely dense wine that is going to be a classic. The dark tannins are still lined with wood aging but that will go because the fruit underneath is also just as dense and intense. Blackberry, black plum and damson plum give power and sweetness. This is a great wine with huge potential. Drink from 2028.",145,Château Cos d'Estournel,France,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe

It is highly perfumed, packed with black fruits and has a dark, firm texture. At the same time, the acidity is intense and the structure tight, suggesting a wine to age.

Cayuse 2008 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Red,Syrah,"medium bodied, balanced",100,"Initially a rather subdued Frog; as if it has been tamed down. Then, suddenly, There's a plush core of blackberry fruit, and the classic Cayuse funkiness is there, drenched in liquid rocks and cured meat and drying tannins. It's all in proportion and a fine reflection of the steely vintage. As it opens gracefully you discover that it is a stunningly refined Frog, quite possibly the best ever; powerful and distinctive, but also elegant, feminine.",80,Cayuse,US,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA)

Masculine aromas of black fruits, cola and oak sit there begging to be sipped, while the lush, deep palate is home to dense blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors.

Lail 2006 J. Daniel Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",95,"Lush, rich, beguiling now. Tastes fat and unctuous, like a Pomerol despite being made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a creamy wealth of cherries, currants, chocolate, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak. For all the flamboyance, it's bone dry, with classically solid Napa tannins, courtesy of fruit from Oakville and Howell Mountain.

Vinifera 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"light, fruity",95,"Here's a young, vital, impressive 100% Cabernet.

This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character.",120,Château Cos d'Estournel,France,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe
Château Latour 2007  Pauillac,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"A big and powerful wine, with tannins that are compact and dense.

Château Mouton Rothschild 2007  Pauillac,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"The wood element is important here, but it is based on a firm Cabernet Sauvignon structure, dry but rich tannins.

As it bursts with exotic barrel flavor, the fruit seems a bit buried, but time after time these wines unfold over the course of decades into glorious maturity. These are arguably the most long-lived and cellarworthy wines in Washington—if not in the entire country.",135,Quilceda Creek,US,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA)
Janzen 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"This wine will divide aficionados. Some will find it too soft and fruity. Others will marvel at its sheer deliciousness. It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and crème de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast.

At first it's quite dense and unyielding, but it opens slowly over a period of days—not hours—remaining dense and compact, with a remarkable array of dark fruits and barrel flavors. As with its companion reds from Quilceda Creek, this is a wine to cellar for decades.",110,Quilceda Creek,US,Washington,Red Mountain

Domaine de Chevalier 2009  Pessac-Léognan,Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"full bodied, robust",95,"Dominating aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the toasty flavor that covers the fruit at this stage. But, like all 2009s, this is a rich wine that will balance out and show all of its opulence.

Gaja 2008 Conteisa Nebbiolo (Langhe),Red,Nebbiolo,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"A tiny percentage of Barbera grapes accounts for why this famous wine is not labeled as a Barolo.

Tasted now, it's dryly tannic, with the black currant and crème de cassis flavors buried under a cloak of astringency. New oak, which comprises 80% of the barrels, adds even greater tannins.

Woodward Canyon 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red,Merlot,"full bodied, robust",95,"True to the dense, muscular style of Woodward Canyon's Merlots, this elevates the complexity in a near-perfect vintage. Deep and textural, it packs together concentrated red fruits, preserves and cassis.

Goldeneye 2007 Ten Degrees Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",98,"This is a best barrel blend of Goldeneye's several vineyards. It takes its beautifully ripe fruit from Confluence and the tannins of The Narrows to yield a dry, densely constructed and moderately ageable wine of exceptionally high quality and appeal.

Only 222 cases were produced.",100,Goldeneye,US,California,Anderson Valley
Arkenstone 2006 Obsidian Red (Howell Mountain),Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,other,97,"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years.",120,Arkenstone,US,California,Howell Mountain
Goldeneye 2007 Confluence Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,other,97,"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them.

Au Sommet 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"full bodied, robust",97,"So good, so rich, so stunning, it's just a joy to drink even now in its youth. Defines the Heidi Barrett style of big, ripe, exuberant fruit and a classic structure, enhanced in this case by the firm tannins and fine acids of Atlas Peak. Explosive in blackberry and cherry pie filling and cassis flavors, with a distinct mineral tang that must come from the volcanic soils. Contains 2% Petit Verdot.

Goldeneye 2007 The Narrows Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",96,"This is a big Pinot Noir, dark and full bodied and juicy in pomegranates, cherries, red plums and sautéed wild mushrooms, and the interplay of oak with fruit even yields richer notes of milk chocolate. It's devastatingly good, but also too young and fresh now to show its best. With its fine tannins and exquisite balance, this articulate young wine should be best after 2013.",75,Goldeneye,US,California,Anderson Valley
Merry Edwards 2007 Meredith Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",97,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014.",54,Merry Edwards,US,California,Russian River Valley
Kendall-Jackson 2007 Highlands Estates Trace Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",96,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs.

Failla 2008 Pearlessence Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Red,Pinot Noir,"full bodied, robust",95,"A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity. With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries. There's a feral quality to the fruit; you can detect notes of mountain eucalyptus, fennel and lavender. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoke. Just lovely, now and through 2014.",40,Failla,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Freemark Abbey 2005 Bosché Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Drier and earthier than many Napa Cabs these days, this wine has subtle sage and sweet licorice that grounds its fruitier flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Very beautiful are the tannins, which are rich and pure, suggesting perfect ripeness. The small Bosché bottling has been a premier one for the winery for many years, and this '05 is one of the best in memory. Should age effortlessly for at least a dozen years.",70,Freemark Abbey,US,California,Rutherford
Chehalem 2006 Statement Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),Red,Pinot Noir,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"This one-of-a-kind offering from Chehalem celebrates what they are calling a “great” vintage.

Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth. But the wine is also very tannic, giving a dry astringency through the finish. Should reward time in the cellar. Best 2012–2018.",100,Flora Springs,US,California,Rutherford
Piña 2007 Buckeye Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,"medium bodied, balanced",95,"Piña has a spectacular record with this wine, and indeed with all their Cabs from Howell Mountain. The '07 is notable for its superb structure. It has pristine tannins and a good, dry mouthfeel, with very rich flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and cedar that are grounded with notes of anise and sweet herbs.

Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",75,Hanzell,US,California,Sonoma Valley

Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",55,Lynmar,US,California,Russian River Valley

Domaine Schoffit 2015 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),White,Pinot Gris,balanced/ complex,96,"Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine.

Julien Schaal 2016 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",96,"Glorious and utterly enticing notes of peach hover on the nose. They are joined by a tart, aromatic citrus tang of bergamot and citrus foliage. The palate has that same alluring aromatic spectrum that unites utter freshness with exoticism. This seems light but also packs an incredible punch. There is energy and verve on the midpalate, which has an utterly compact, concentrated but fluid texture.

Fragrant herbs—think chervil and yarrow—also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate.

Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),White,Pinot Gris,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",96,"Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously.

EnRoute 2015 Brumaire Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"This rich and voluptuous wine wins one over with its baked pear and vanilla sumptuousness, etched with an apple blossom aroma. Robust and velvety on the palate, it's balanced by fresh citrus and wet stone nuances. The lifted acidity provokes both succulence and complexity.",40,EnRoute,US,California,Russian River Valley
Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Hengst Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,95,"A funky whiff of yeast has to blow off before wonderfully pure orange zest notes appear. The palate has a wonderful richness of texture, something earthy with a pithy, beautiful grip. The flavors are still taut, for now (just zesty aromatic orange peel) but much more still hides and sleeps below the surface. This is powerful and concentrated, with a lovely and enduring backbone of freshness. This needs bottle age to come into its own. The finish is fresh, clean and lasting. Drink 2020–2037.",56,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,France,Alsace,Alsace
Gustave Lorentz 2011 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"A touch of luscious peach plays among the ripe lemon notes of the nose. A heady chamomile lift hints at some evolution. The absolutely dry palate is still vividly fresh and has barely begun to unfurl its store of rich aromas. For now the luminous freshness and brightness of pure ripe lemon zest still dominates. Here and there a touch of candle wax, stone and chamomile appears. From the 2011, this has barely begun its journey. A lovely, incisive, intense but elegant wine with a clean refreshing finish. Drink 2017–2030.",60,Gustave Lorentz,France,Alsace,Alsace
Hugel 2011 Grossi Laüe Pinot Gris (Alsace),White,Pinot Gris,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"Heady notes of chamomile and dried hay flower stream from the glass immediately hinting at a wine with some evolution. A touch of candied lemon peel makes the nose even more enticing. The palate is generous but dry, showing off the pristine pear fruit and wonderful phenolic texture that gives as much structure to this wine as its fine pure lemony acidity. Savored slowly, the full depth of pure pear fruit becomes apparent. This is a class act just coming into its drinking window now, with ample potential for further aging. Drink 2017–2035.",75,Hugel,France,Alsace,Alsace
Jean Biecher & Fils 2016 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"A tender but enticing touch of peach rises from the glass. There also is a glint of smoke and a touch of lemon zestiness. It is lemon and tangy citrus that takes over on the taut linear palate. Zestiness fizzes and gives the concentrated palate a wonderfully weightless feel that belies the depth of fruit. This is totally appetizing and refreshing with a dry, moreish finish. Drink 2017–2035.",45,Jean Biecher & Fils,France,Alsace,Alsace
Marc Kreydenweiss 2014 Kastelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,95,"A funky earthy touch hovers on the nose before hints of nettle and lemon balm add an aromatic edge to lemon freshness. On the exquisitely dry palate, it is the vivid, bright and intense lemon freshness that takes over, but those earthier notes still flash up around the edges, adding interest and depth. They will unfurl more as time passes. While this is linear, incisive and precise now, it will truly shine with bottle age. Drink 2017–2037.",45,Marc Kreydenweiss,France,Alsace,Alsace
Perrier Jouët 2004 Belle Epoque Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Now at its peak, this impressive wine has moved from fruit to maturity, adding toastiness to its acidity and giving the wine richness.

Moulin Touchais 1996 Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon),White,Chenin Blanc,balanced/ complex,95,"This estate, owned by the same family since 1787, has amazing stocks of old sweet wines maturing in its cellars. With red apple, honey and apricot aromas, this wine, mature and yet so fresh, is proof of the aging ability of Chenin Blanc. It is the balance between the ripe honeyed flavors and the intense acidity that keeps it so vibrant. Drink this superb wine now.",55,Moulin Touchais,France,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon
Paul Blanck 2014 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"Dried lemon peel and hay flowers make for an inviting nose. On the palate, the vivid brightness of lemon brightens notes of tart apple and the merest touch of earth and stone. This is precise and pure, absolutely dry and magnificent. The freshness is incisive and invigorating. It's another one of those gloriously bright and unapologetically fresh 2014 Rieslings. Clearly a vintage for adults only. The finish is lip-smackingly clean and utterly moreish. Drink 2017–2037.",36,Paul Blanck,France,Alsace,Alsace
Lynmar 2015 Old Wente Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"With its high-toned sparkle of lemon zest and orange, this lovely wine evolves to show rich oak and apple pie notes, evoking baked Gravenstein apple, cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium-bodied, it wears its concentration of flavor and texture well, finding a well-earned balance through the lengthy finish.",55,Lynmar,US,California,Russian River Valley
Domaine Gresser 2014 Kastelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"A very shy closed nose gives little away but the palate reveals all. A beautifully lithe and fluid synthesis of ripe and tart orchard fruits is leavened by bright citrus, green pear, Cox's apple and pure ripe Amalfi lemon. There also is a fine hint of discreet herbal lift—chamomile and chervil can be glimpsed here and there. What an aromatic, statuesque beauty. Alluring now but absolutely certain to become spectacular with some age. The finish is totally dry, aromatic and long. Drink 2017–2037.",72,Domaine Gresser,France,Alsace,Alsace
Arista 2014 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"This wine delivers creamy, divine deliciousness from some of the vineyard's oldest vines.

Louis Jadot 2014 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"With its potent mixture of intense fruit and equally concentrated structure, this wine is an obvious candidate for long-term aging. Showing ripe yellow fruit, almond hints and a strong mineral texture, it will develop slowly and be best from 2022. This vineyard, one of the most familiar of Puligny-Montrachet's premier crus, is also one of the highest on the slope.",109,Louis Jadot,France,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet
Domaine Billaud-Simon 2014 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"Beautifully rich, this wine is ripe and full of concentrated fruit.

Pieropan 2011 La Rocca  (Soave Classico),White,Garganega,balanced/ complex,95,"This stunning single-vineyard selection is one of Italy's most iconic whites and helped kick off Soave's renaissance. It delivers pressed yellow flowers, golden apples, citrus, melon and mango alongside mineral and toasted almond notes. Already delicious and well balanced, it will age beautifully and develop more complexity for several years at least. Drink through 2021.",31,Pieropan,Italy,Veneto,Soave Classico
Taittinger 2005 Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"With just a touch of bottle age giving a toasty character, this impressive wine is already showing some maturity. That said, the apple and citrus character, the mineral tight texture and crisp acidity promise some aging. The wine conveys a sense of elegance, intensity and richness. Drink now, but the wine will also age.",170,Taittinger,France,Champagne,Champagne
Louis Latour 2015  Corton-Charlemagne,White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"A flagship wine for this producer, this is rich and seductive, opulent even. Bold yellow fruits, ripe apples and pears are surrounded by a youthful texture that will allow it to age. The fruit and the touches of wood are still present, but will integrate beautfully. Drink this wine from 2023.",165,Louis Latour,France,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne
Gary Farrell 2014 Russian River Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"Dark yellow in color, this wine shows tangy green apple and a richer, more concentrated element of apple-spice cake, with supportive, balanced acidity. With a bright, lifted finish, this less-expensive offering compared with many of the producer's single-vineyard designates never lets up on complexity or deliciousness.",35,Gary Farrell,US,California,Russian River Valley
Marimar Estate 2007 Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"This is easily the richest, densest, most complex of Marimar's 2007 Chardonnays. Made with extended lees contact, it has a fleshy, yeasty freshness that gives the wine extra layers. The grape flavors show typical Green Valley long hangtime notes of exotic tropical fruits, apricots, pears, honey, buttered toast, crème brûlée and sweet baking spices, brightened with acidity. A luxurious, splendid Chardonnay to drink now.",45,Marimar Estate,US,California,Russian River Valley
Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",75,Hanzell,US,California,Sonoma Valley
EOS 2006 Tears of Dew Late Harvest Moscato (Paso Robles),White,Moscato,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"With 21% residual sugar, this is an enormously sweet wine, one of the most honeyed of the vintage. A little sugar goes a long way, of course, but this wine also charms with rich, powerful apricot, peach and vanilla custard flavors, perfectly balanced with crisp acidity. With consistently high scores over the years, Tears of Dew has taken a place in the front ranks of California dessert white wines.",22,EOS,US,California,Paso Robles
Salon 1985 Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),White,Chardonnay,other white,96,"An enormously complex and rich wine that almost defies description. Golden apples, raisins and pears; bread, cream, vanilla, honey and nuts. The list goes on and on. Full and rich; the mousse is extremely fine and creamy-textured in the mouth. Drinking beautifully now, it will probably hold another ten years or more. Even better than a bottle reviewed last year.",216,Salon,France,Champagne,Champagne
Del Dotto 2009 Cinghiale Vineyard Family Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,96,"Rich and complex, this dry, terroir-driven wine completely avoids the sweet butter creaminess and jamminess of so many Chardonnays, showcasing instead notes of tropical fruits and pears. It's framed by minerals and even a fresh herbaceousness that suggests the wild plants growing around this Sonoma Coast vineyard. While the oak influences are strong, they are perfectly in keeping with the underlying volume.",125,Del Dotto,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Del Dotto 2009 Cinghiale Vineyard Gerard's Blend Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"This is so dry, minerally and richly complex, you'd swear you were drinking great French Chablis. Brisk acidity and a steely stoniness give the apricot and citrus fruits a backbone of iron and iodine. Oak is there, but subtly lurking in the background, lending a hint of buttered toast. A beautiful wine, classy and upscale for drinking now.",85,Del Dotto,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Château Guiraud 2005  Sauternes,White,Bordeaux-style White Blend,balanced/ complex,95,"Typical of the huge power of Guiraud, this is one of the richest Sauternes in 2005.

Flavors of honey, almonds and peaches give the wine extra complexity.",65,Château Guiraud,France,Bordeaux,Sauternes
Château Doisy-Daëne 2005  Barsac,White,Bordeaux-style White Blend,balanced/ complex,95,"Under the control of white wine wizard Denis Dubourdieu, this is one of the great wines of Barsac.

Domaine Bernhard & Reibel 2010 Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,95,"Beeswax and dried chamomile flowers, baked apple and lanolin, lemon rind and a touch of honey: while these aromas are rich on the nose, they become even more bountiful on the palate, filling mouth and mind with their high-wire acrobatics that teeter between steely precision and decadent richness. This late harvest style shows off Riesling's aromatics to great effect. The finish is incredibly zesty and fresh. While this is already evolved, it shows no signs of tiredness and is sure to delight for years to come. Concentration and balance are phenomenal. The haunting aroma of lanolin gets under your skin. Drink now through 2030.",70,Domaine Bernhard & Reibel,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Jebsal Pinot Gris (Alsace),White,Pinot Gris,balanced/ complex,95,"The nose is still closed and gives away little. The palate has a voluptuous shape but comes tightly corseted: all is present but still closely held. The peachy fruit has a serene easy sweetness that has its perfect counter measure in orange and Meyer lemon freshness. This is poised and sweet but countered and cut by immense freshness. The aromas have yet to unfold fully. Both blood orange and peach lurk promisingly. It is the seamless poised texture of this late harvest that stands out, along with supreme purity. Wait for this.

Domaine Ostertag 2015 Fronholz Pinot Gris (Alsace),White,Pinot Gris,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"The nose suggests utter generosity of ripe juicy pear fruit. The palate enforces this with rounded, aromatic and very pure notes of ripe Bartlett pear. The flavors are precisely drawn, framed by incisive freshness that corsets the richness and gives it a beautiful outline. There is barely concealed strength here and great energy. You can feel the warmth of the sun that ripened these lovely grapes. The finish is lasting and dry. Drink 2017—2030.",57,Domaine Ostertag,France,Alsace,Alsace
Trimbach 2013 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"Pure citrus zest rises from the glass: lovely, ripe lemon and zesty lime. The palate reinforces these flavors in a rapier-like fashion, with drive and energy in a very linear energetic way. This seem like an elixir or a tonic full of vim, all informed by a central dynamic freshness. This has barely blossomed but promises much future pleasure. This genie should be contained in its bottle for a while longer before letting it loose. It's something to look forward to. Drink 2020–2035.",34,Trimbach,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2013 Valmur Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"This apple-crisp wine has tight acidity and touches of wood rounded out by yellow fruits.

It will age slowly, so don't drink before 2020.",97,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils,France,Burgundy,Chablis
Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2013 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Mineral and flinty at the start, this young wine has an intense structure. Tannins and fruit skins give a strong, tight texture. At the same time, the acidity is just as intense, crisp and juicy, tight and needing many years to develop. Drink from 2018.",39,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin,France,Burgundy,Chablis
Domaine Méo-Camuzet 2013  Corton-Charlemagne,White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"This is a powerful, ripe wine, touched by its wood aging while having rich yellow fruits and a dense structure. Nervous tension comes from the acidity and the strongly mineral texture. It's a magnificent wine that needs aging, so drink from 2019.",307,Domaine Méo-Camuzet,France,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne
Domaine Pinson 2013 Mont de Milieu Premier Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"Rich and open, this is a generous, full-throated wine. There is a good contrast between the ripeness and a line of acidity that gives a steely, textured backbone. The end combines the two characters, a ripe, full aftertaste cut with a touch of steel. Drink from 2017.",42,Domaine Pinson,France,Burgundy,Chablis
Sandhi 2013 Sanford & Benedict Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"Lime peels and lemon pith mix it up with rain on cement, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf, ocean-spray saltiness and a lemon-pepper spice on the nose of this wine from the appellation's first vineyard. The palate is reminiscent of a perfectly restrained margarita, with the warmth of sea salt, the pungency of squeezed caviar limes and the body of lemon curds, topped with a sprig of mint.",55,Sandhi,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Trisaetum 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),White,Chardonnay,other white,95,"This conveys a heady mix of luscious French oak, butter and toast, plus roasted nuts, a dash of Cognac, orange oil, apple sauce and baked pear.

Trisaetum 2014 Wichmann Dundee Estate Riesling (Dundee Hills),White,Riesling,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"Details of tea leaf, peach skin and pear introduce a wine with tremendous texture and length.

Januik 2012 Bacchus Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"Spectacular is the word that comes to mind here. Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over. A mix of citrus oils, tree fruits, a hint of honey, tea, lemon verbena and more, it delivers astonishing complexity and flavor for such a young wine. It should continue to evolve and improve from 2024–2034.",20,Januik,US,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA)
Abeja 2012 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),White,Viognier,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"Simply sensational, this estate-grown Viognier raises the bar for everyone.

Outstanding concentration, focus and depth, with juicy acidity underlying an astonishing finish.",30,Abeja,US,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Flowers 2011 Moon Select Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,other white,97,"Let the conversations about minerality begin. Whatever it is, or wherever it comes from, it's here big time, adding a lick of steel and a metallic mouthfeel to the underlying fruit. And what powerful fruit it is, ranging from orange and guava to honeydew and citron. This bone dry, crisp Chardonnay is a game changer that will make you look at California Chardonnay differently.",70,Flowers,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Domaine Schoffit 2014 Rangen Grand Cru Clos Saint Théobald Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,95,"The spicy, evocative scent of Seville orange peel entices from the first sniff. The palate is dry, restrained and sylph-like but with time reveals tangerine and lemon zest. This is a feast, a celebration of citrus flavors, unfolding and shimmering at every moment.

Domaine Serene 2013 Evenstad Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"This is a sensational vintage for this cuvée, which is part of the winery's extensive Chardonnay lineup. It offers intense fruit concentration and retains the opulence for which the winery is known. Rich in a buttered, toasted nut flavor, the mouthfeel is creamy and sensual.

Domaine Weinbach 2014 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"Subtle notes of earth mix with summer blossom, along with hints of honey, quince and zesty, fresh lemon peel. These aromas dance and take turns on the dry, balanced palate that shines both with rich fruit and slender tone. Lemony freshness pervades everything with its brightness. This is lovely now but will be even lovelier over the years. Drink 2016–2030.",46,Domaine Weinbach,France,Alsace,Alsace

Trimbach 2008 Cuvée Frédéric Emile Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages. This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030.",60,Trimbach,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Ostertag 2014 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose.

Shea 2013 Shea Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Here is an utterly irresistible wine—spicy, sensuous and layered with beautifully ripened citrus, tree and tropical fruits.

Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),White,Gewürztraminer,other white,95,"The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive—there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent. A masterful tightrope walk amidst plump fruit and mineral precision with a finishing, pleasantly bitter edge of marzipan.",120,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,France,Alsace,Alsace
Gary Farrell 2013 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",96,"To tame Durell is no easy feat—indeed at first this wine exudes matchstick and robustness on the nose and palate.

Joseph Drouhin 2007 Marquis de Laguiche Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"The magnificent wines from the Marquis de Laguiche estate are produced by Joseph Drouhin.

Defines the cool coastal climate of the Sonoma Coast, with brilliant, citrusy acidity brightening long hangtime flavors of tropical fruits, green apples and succulent peaches and pears.

Avignonesi 1997 375ml  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano),White,White Blend,"sweet, juicy, soft",97,"Made with Malvasia Toscano and Trebbiano grapes (unlike the slightly more complex Occhio di Pernice Vin Santo, which is made from Sangiovese), this is a delightfully rich and concentrated sweet wine that boasts unreal levels of intensity and personality.

Bouchard Père & Fils 2007  Chevalier-Montrachet,White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage.

This one's for you. It's tremendous in ripe pineapple, pear, peach, mango, lime, tangerine and papaya flavors.

Château Clos Haut-Peyraguey 2013  Sauternes,White,Bordeaux-style White Blend,balanced/ complex,95,"As is often the case, a poor red wine vintage in Bordeaux is a good year for sweet wines. This unctuous wine, still young and dominated by 95% Sémillon, is beautifully balanced. Its honey and botrytis flavors give it a dry edge that comfortably contrasts with the opulent sweetness. The acidity, a source of freshness, gives the wine the lift it needs. Drink this serious and major wine from 2023.",45,Château Clos Haut-Peyraguey,France,Bordeaux,Sauternes

The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened.

Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,96,"Very faint notes of mandarine and earth emanate from this delicate, closed wine. All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision. Smoke and salt characterize the long finish. Drink 2019–2035.",100,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Schoffit 2006 Rangen Grand Cru Clos Saint Théobald Sélection de Grains Nobles Gewurztraminer (Alsace),White,Gewürztraminer,balanced/ complex,95,"A heady and lifted nose suggests healing herbs steeped in honey. The palate is rich and unctuous but fresh with the lemon peel, herb and clear honey notes that were already present on the nose.

René Muré 2014 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"The purity of juicy, tart, red apples runs like a fault line through a very taut, linear, whistle-clean Riesling. This has purity and precision, linearity and drive. Still tightly wound, this needs time to unfold but promises to be a wine of great longevity and expression.

René Muré 2013 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"Very enticing but ever so ethereal notes of tropical fruit are hinted at: yellow and pink grapefruit, passion fruit and even some pineapple. The palate is still in thrall to all the primary citrus notes but holds promise of stone and riper fruit. This is taut, elegant, concentrated, dry and whistle-clean.

René Muré 2015 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",97,"The heady aromatic scent of fresh tangerine peel takes turns with the refreshing perfume of green Seville oranges. The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now. Keep this genie in its bottle for a while longer, if only to see what fascinating direction it takes. This is wondrous. Drink 2022–2037.",50,René Muré,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Ostertag 2015 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,97,"There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too.

The palate has absolute concentration and energy and more of that smoky promise. This is like the bundled focus of a laser light—incisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean. Wait for this. Drink 2025–2040 at least.",120,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,France,Alsace,Alsace
Trimbach 2014 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,97,"An earthy touch of freshly turned soil clings to the pure apple note on the nose. On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow.

René Muré 2015 Zinnkoepfle Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,96,"Whiffs of red-cheeked mirabelle plum, tart red apple, a touch of earth and vivid tangerine immediately signal pleasure. The absolutely straightlaced, concentrated and dry palate adds hints of quince and blood orange. This is dry, even lean but absolutely powerful with bundled flavor. You can feel heat and energy at the core of this, there is real ripeness and force here, played against absolute, vivid and cleansing freshness. High drama indeed. Let it age a while before playing it out. It will be worth the wait. Drink 2022–2037.",65,René Muré,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,96,"A touch of flinty reduction still hangs over the nose, subduing the varietal aromas. But this is only a sign of youth, as is the residual carbon dioxide on the palate. While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself. Drink 2018–2037.",100,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Steingrubler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",96,"Tender pure peach and fine spicy notions of grapefruit zest unite to create a very inviting nose. The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh. A triumphantly long finish adds the allure of blood orange to this seductive, aromatic wine and makes it utterly irresistible. Drink 2017–2037.",38,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,France,Alsace,Alsace

Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Steingrubler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,95,"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean. Drink now through 2035.",44,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Ostertag 2014 A360P Muenchberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),White,Pinot Gris,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"Utter generosity of both ripe and dried pear is immediately evident on the nose. Notions of sandalwood hover. The dry palate carries that same, generous fluidity at its deep core. There is immense concentration, shimmering with dried, fresh and cooked pear. But there also is a sense of earth, stone and fresh orange peel. The wine seems like a message from another world, , leading you beyond the physical, into a wold of contemplation. The finish lasts and lasts.",83,Domaine Ostertag,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Bott-Geyl 2014 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"The heady scent of grapefruit and tangelo peel immediately add savoriness to the crisp green-apple fruit that is evident on the nose. But there are also richer hints of honey and yellow apple. The palate remains taut, slender and linear but that tangelo spice is boosted by enticing herbal notes of yarrow and a dollop of yeast. This is an aromatic marvel. The finish is dry and intense. This will keep your interest for years. Drink now through 2035.",41,Domaine Bott-Geyl,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Pfister 2012 Engelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",45,Domaine Pfister,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Sipp-Mack 2014 Osterberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,95,"There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last. Drink now through 2035.",43,Domaine Sipp-Mack,France,Alsace,Alsace
Ojai 2007 Clos Pepe Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",96,"Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture. The oak is flamboyant, but perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dazzling and dramatic, from a vineyard that just keeps performing better and better.",38,Ojai,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Williams Selyem 2008 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",50,Williams Selyem,US,California,Russian River Valley
Tantara 2007 Talley Rincon Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"Massively rich, with pronounced, sweet, smoky oak flavors and a rich vein of tart, creamy lees highlighting the underlying fruity ripeness.

Melville 2008 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors.

Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",26,Melville,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Au Bon Climat 2007 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",25,Au Bon Climat,US,California,Santa Barbara County
The Eyrie Vineyards 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,96,"Even if winemaker Jason Lett tripled the price of this wine, it would still be a standout among its peers. This opens with intense aromatics of pineapple fruit, bracing acidity and compelling length.

Drink now through 2035.",27,The Eyrie Vineyards,US,Oregon,Dundee Hills
The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Original Vines Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"The oldest Chardonnay vines in the Willamette Valley, planted in 1965, create a spicy, textural, refined wine with tremendous length and detail.

Arrowood 2009 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley),White,Viognier,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"A brilliant, completely satisfying Viognier that shows its sunny California terroir in the ripe lemon, peach and mango flavors.

Domaine Weinbach 2011 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",96,"This is, quite simply, great Riesling. It has all the subtlety that the grape can produce, as well as a sense of longevity.

Trimbach 2007 Cuvée Frédéric Emile Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"One of Trimbach's top wines, this impressive Riesling, with all its bottle time, is maturing beautifully. It has that petrol character that is typical of aged Riesling, as well as a strong sense of steeliness and intense acidity on the finish. It is probably at its peak now, but will drink well until 2018.",65,Trimbach,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Weinbach 2011 Cuvée Laurence Gewurztraminer (Alsace),White,Gewürztraminer,balanced/ complex,95,"Laurence Faller is the family winemaker at Domaine Weinbach, and this wine is a tribute to her skills.

Domaines Schlumberger 2009 Kessler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"There is both wonderful bite and density to this great wine. It has a weighty texture full of ripe, rich fruit. At the same time, the wine is bone dry and crisp with acidity. It' s just beginning to mature, and while enjoyable now, it's better to wait until 2016.",30,Domaines Schlumberger,France,Alsace,Alsace
Trisaetum 2010 Estates Reserve Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"A two-barrel selection consisting of the favorite sweeter barrel from each of the two estate vineyards.

Ramey 2012 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",97,"This wine is deliciously elegant yet decadently rich in all the right ways, from a prime, longtime vineyard source planted to vines over 40 years old.

Ramey 2012 Woolsey Road Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,96,"This wine comes from a new vineyard source for the producer, who continues to astound with Chardonnay.

Ramey 2012 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,96,"This longstanding collaboration between vintner and grower reflects years of mutual understanding and respect.

Shafer 2009 Red Shoulder Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,96,"Shafer consistently produces one of the biggest, fruitiest Chardonnays in California, and yet the wine remains balanced and interesting. The 2009 Red Shoulder Ranch is gigantic in pineapples, pears, mangoes, tangerines and honey, yet so minerally and crisp that somehow it finishes dry.",48,Shafer,US,California,Carneros
Nicolaysen Family Vineyards 2001 Late Harvest Alisos Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Santa Barbara County),White,Gewürztraminer,balanced/ complex,95,"At nearly 10 years of age, this beautiful Gewürz shows how well a good California dessert wine can age. It's still brisk in clean acidity, but is honeyed and sweet, with nearly 19% residual sugar. Shows rich, exotic pineapple, tangerine marmalade, gingerbread, apricot jam, buttered toast, crème brûlée, vanilla cream and spice flavors, leading to a long, deliriously delicious finish. A heady, flamboyantly sweet wine to drink now.",50,Nicolaysen Family Vineyards,US,California,Santa Barbara County
Domaine Pinson 2013 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,96,"This wine brings out the structure inherent in this vineyard. Tensely textured with young fruits that have a touch of bitterness, the wine offers kiwi and green plum flavors given a more exotic character with some mango. It's a deeply structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",73,Domaine Pinson,France,Burgundy,Chablis
Joseph Drouhin 2013 Marquis de Laguiche Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Perfumed and floral, this is a wine with weight and richness.

William Fèvre 2013 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"From vines on the sunny side of the vineyard, this wine is richly textured and structured, full of generous yellow and white fruits, spice and layers of wood aging.

Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2013 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"This wine has a rich, fat, almost buttery character. Certainly the acidity is there, although it has a warm, summer feel. The structure typical of Les Clos is all there as well, giving concentration and density. At the end spice goes with the extreme freshness of the citrus aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",106,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils,France,Burgundy,Chablis
Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2013 Grenouilles Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"This rich, generous and soft wine has a ripe feel along with plenty of acidity.

Domaine Pinson 2013 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"From ripe fruits, in the Pinson style, this is a rich, generous and concentrated wine.

Sandhi 2013 Mt. Carmel Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),White,Chardonnay,other white,95,"Lime and apple blossoms, gray slate, wet chalk, a touch of struck match and an ever-so-slight lemon-butter element converge on a wondrous nose in this Rajat Parr-Sashi Moorman winner. Once sipped, the tight citrus hits first, but then come approachable white flowers, golden pears and a touch of ghee and vanilla on the back end.",55,Sandhi,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Joseph Drouhin 2013 Clos de la Garenne Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),White,Chardonnay,other white,95,"This offers toast and spice aromas, with opulent apricots and white peaches along with intense freshness from the acidity and linear structure.

Joseph Drouhin 2013 Drouhin-Vaudon Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"A very mineral, flinty character comes through the powerful texture of this rich, dense wine.

Sandhi 2013 Bentrock Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"This is one of the most expensive white wines on the Central Coast, and it's mighty good, with aromas of cheese rind, lime pith, slate and tiny bits of Marcona almond and oak smoke. It's laser-focused on the chalky, mineral-laden palate, with poached apples in the midpalate and lemon peels and tangerine rinds throughout.",90,Sandhi,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
William Fèvre 2013 Valmur Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"This is the coolest and freshest of the Grand Cru vineyards. The wine is tight, steely with a nervy core of acidity that gives it a textured, structured character. It is full of energy, crisp, packed with apples and citrus and needing several years aging.

Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2013 Valmur Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"This apple-crisp wine has tight acidity and touches of wood rounded out by yellow fruits.

It will age slowly, so don't drink before 2020.",97,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils,France,Burgundy,Chablis
Château d'Yquem 2005  Sauternes,White,Bordeaux-style White Blend,"sweet, juicy, soft",97,"This isn't sweet, but just so wonderfully rich. It's the concentration of botrytis that makes the wine. The texture is velvet, but with a spicy bite to it. Apricot, honey and marzipan all contribute to a wine that will age over decades.",800,Château d'Yquem,France,Bordeaux,Sauternes
Ramey 2012 Platt Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Not many producers get fruit from this magical vineyard, sought after for being cool, coastal and meticulously farmed.

D'Alfonso-Curran 2013 White Hills Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",96,"This Chardonnay—one of the best tasted in months—is light in the glass and shows clean, refreshing, yet compellingly rich sea salt, toasted sourdough, key lime and daffodil aromas.

Domaine Ostertag 2015 Fronholz Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"sweet, juicy, soft",96,"Peach and tangerine unite to create an utterly seductive nose: luscious juicy flesh is defined by aromatic spice and zestiness. These opposites play off each other and create something that is alive and vigorous, joyful and precious. There is concentration and poise, structure and texture, but none of this concerns the hedonistic forces at play. They just want to express their careless exuberance. There is something defiant about this dry concentrated wine. Perhaps it is a welcome and encouraging counterweight to so much sadness in the world.",48,Domaine Ostertag,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Ostertag 2015 Heissenberg Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,balanced/ complex,95,"A heady swirl of Amalfi lemon hits you right in the heart, if not the nose. The lemon notes become even more fully expressed on the taut but full, streamlined but expressive and dry body: they take the rich guise of lemon oil and candied peel. They are utterly tart and fresh but with that golden ripeness at their very core that makes this rather seductive. Taste buds just want to get to the bottom of this and rejoice in the purity and fruity tang. This is translucent and refreshing but also rich and full of delicious lemony vigor. The finish is lip-smacking. It will be hard to resist this, but this is certain to get even better. Drink now through 2035.",48,Domaine Ostertag,France,Alsace,Alsace
Joseph Phelps 2015 Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Voluptuously succulent and welcoming, this coastal wine seduces with its caramel apple, pear and preserved lemon flavors, edged with high-toned acidity and an exotic touch of seaspray. That sense of the sea plays out on the palate in texture, too, with a stony note that lingers in nutty spice.",55,Joseph Phelps,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Windsbuhl Gewurztraminer (Alsace),White,Gewürztraminer,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness. This is yet to unfold fully. Lovely now, sure to improve. Drink 2020—2035.",80,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,France,Alsace,Alsace
Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Windsbuhl Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"Funky notions of yeast still cloud the nose. The palate gives us tense, concentrated lemon and tangerine zest at first but you feel that there is more strength, almost raw force, at the core of this that still needs to develop and work out its balance. This is a big wine, energetic and dry, intense and generous but not yet fully fledged. Drinking it now would rob it of its as of yet untapped essence. For now it is lemon purity that holds sway but there will be so much more. Cellar from 2022–2035, at least.",80,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,France,Alsace,Alsace
Keller Estate 2007 Precioso Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals.

Two Sisters 2008 Courtney's Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"Chardonnay doesn't get much riper or richer than this.

Drink now.",55,Two Sisters,US,California,Sta. Rita Hills
Failla 2010 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",99,"Shows classic, full-throttle notes of tropical and citrus fruits, pears and sweet green apples, combined with strong minerality and complex layers of buttered toast, honey and creamy lees. The description alone hardly does justice to the wine's beauty. The acidity is perfect, the oak deftly applied, the finish long and completely satisfying. Winemaker Ehren Jordan suggests pairing it with simple fare like roast chicken and salted fingerling potatoes.",44,Failla,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Lynmar 2010 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,96,"A splendid Chardonnay, rich, vital and elegant, with so many layers of interest. Framed by a cut of brilliant acidity, it evolves with complex flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, minerals, flowers and honey, then finishes long and savory in a swirl of spices. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast, while the wine is a study in the creamy effect of sur lie aging. It's perfectly dry on the finish.",50,Lynmar,US,California,Russian River Valley
Lynmar 2010 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"A bone dry wine that's rich in steely minerals and wonderful acidity. It offers the elegance and complexity of a great premier cru, with tantalizing traces of sweet Meyer lemons, limes and exotic spices. The oak is subtle, lending aromas and flavors of buttered toast, while its time spent on the lees contributes notes of sour cream. A fabulous success for this or any vintage.",40,Lynmar,US,California,Russian River Valley
Sojourn 2013 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",95,"Sizzling lemon and Asian pear-tinged acidity give this wine an electricity on the palate that finds its companion in the richer overtones of racy cardamom and nutmeg. The 40% new French oak imparts structure and spice rather than an overt influence, letting the complex stone minerality and depth of fruit linger on the finish.",48,Sojourn,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Leon Beyer 2008 Comtes d'Eguisheim Riesling (Alsace),White,Riesling,other white,95,"Lifted peach and chamomile just hint at the maturity of this wine that has barely begun its trajectory. The palate is still taut and firm, fresh with lemon zest and singing with an evolved, lifted purity. This does not need sweetness to propel its flavor: its slender poise and purity make it soar on its own. The more you taste, the more you find: drops of soy, glints of stone, shimmers of citrus and lanolin. It's gorgeous, concentrated, incisive and long.",66,Leon Beyer,France,Alsace,Alsace
Mount Eden Vineyards 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"One of the greatest Chardonnays made in California each vintage, this bottling blends riper elements of yellow peach and honey with the tension of tangerine rind and pink-grapefruit pith on the nose.

Joseph Phelps 2010 Pastorale Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",96,"Undoubtedly the greatest Chardonnay the winery has ever produced, this is as rich as any Chardonnay on the market. Notes of tropical fruit, green apple and crème brûlée mesh with vibrant minerality that's steely, chalky and tangy. Although it tastes of honey, the finish is completely dry. This might even develop earthy, nutty complexities as it ages.",75,Joseph Phelps,US,California,Sonoma Coast
Louis Latour 2015  Montrachet,White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,97,"This opulent, powerful wine has weight, richness and a beautiful creamy texture. It's built to age, from its wood aging to its minerality. Concentrated, it offers yellow fruits shot through with acidity.

Louis Latour 2015  Bâtard-Montrachet,White,Chardonnay,"dry, briny, crisp, acidic",96,"Wood, ripe fruit and a tight texture give this wine a very complete feeling.

Albert Bichot 2015 Domaine Long-Depaquit Moutonne  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Regarded almost as a Grand Cru in its own right, the Moutonne vineyard, wholly owned by Albert Bichot, is in a corner of the Vaudésir Grand Cru vineyard. In this sumptuous year, the wine is more generous, ripe yellow fruits than mineral texture. The acidity and the tangy aftertaste are a reminder that this is from cool-climate Chablis. Drink from 2023.",154,Albert Bichot,France,Burgundy,Chablis
Domaine des Croix 2011  Corton-Charlemagne,White,Chardonnay,other white,95,"A dry, mineral wine, hiding its potential richness. Flavors of ripe pears and yellow fruits are matched by lime acidity. The wine has considerable power and a dense character, showing the immense density that comes from this vineyard. Age for 4–6 years and more.",160,Domaine des Croix,France,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne
Domaine Leflaive 2010 Les Combettes Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"With its structured, mineral character, this is a serious, ageworthy wine. It has a sense of coiled power and steel and a dense, complex texture that brings out both its ripe, pure fruit character and its intensity.

Domaine Leflaive 2010 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),White,Chardonnay,"sweet, juicy, soft",95,"A rich wine, full and fruity up front, then opening up into a much more mineral, textured character.

La Chablisienne 2010 Château Grenouilles Grand Cru  (Chablis),White,Chardonnay,balanced/ complex,95,"Château Grenouilles is a parcel within the Grenouilles Grand Cru, a monopoly of the La Chablisienne cooperative.

Louis Roederer 2008 Cristal Vintage Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",100,"This latest incarnation of the famous brand is a superb wine. It is on par with, maybe even better than, the already legendary 2002. Its balance is impeccable: Apple and citrus flavors working with the tight minerality to give a textured yet fruity wine. Produced from Roederer's own vineyards which are mainly biodynamic, the wine has its own intense purity and crispness. It has amazing potential and is likely to age for many years. Drink from 2020.",250,Louis Roederer,France,Champagne,Champagne
Louis Roederer 2008 Cristal Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",96,"Interestingly released after the softer 2009 version of this wine, this 2008 vintage is beautifully balanced between crisp fruit and ripe maturity. With its red fruits still in place, it also has a toasty yeasty edge that is sophisticated and enticing. It is a superb wine, delicious to drink now although because of the quality of the vintage it will age for many more years, certainly into the 2020s.",600,Louis Roederer,France,Champagne,Champagne
Roederer Estate 2007 Brut L'Ermitage Estate Bottled Sparkling (Anderson Valley),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,other sparkling,95,"Very fruity and fresh in aroma, this elegant wine has light, crisp apple and lemon flavors, fresh-baked bread accents and lively acidity. A layered texture seems to blend in accents of almond and vanilla, increasing complexity with each sip. It's one of California's blue-chip bubblies.",48,Roederer Estate,US,California,Anderson Valley
Schramsberg 2004 Reserve Sparkling (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",98,"The opulence of this sparkling wine has to be tasted to be believed. It's far softer and silkier than the winery's companion new release, the 2005 J. Schram, but then the blend is the complete opposite. This one's mainly Pinot Noir, with the balance from Chardonnay. The Pinot Noir brings a warm, raspberry- and cherry-sauce richness to Chardonnay's limes and pears, while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole, as if it had been gently smoked. So enticing now, it's hard to keep from drinking the whole bottle, and you certainly can, but this is a wine that will age for 10–15 years.",110,Schramsberg,US,California,Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin
Schramsberg 2004 J. Schram Rosé Sparkling (North Coast),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,other sparkling,98,"An awesome rosé, just a tremendous feat. Made from 11 vineyards in 4 counties, it shows a masterful art of the blend. Insanely rich in toasted bread and lees, showing the influence of six years in the bottle. A tremendous core of strawberries, raspberries, orange zest, roasted macadamia, roasted coconut, pear liqueur and honey lasts into the finish. Despite the richness, the wine is dry. So lovely now you can hardly keep your hands off, but it should age gracefully for the next 10–15 years.",130,Schramsberg,US,California,North Coast
Domaine Carneros 2006 Le Rêve Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Carneros),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"Made entirely from Chardonnay, it shows real delicacy and richness, with a mousse as smooth as fine satin. Flavorwise, it's enormously rich, suggesting oranges, limes, honey, vanilla, toast and the sweet, yeasty doughiness of a brioche pastry. Really gorgeous, a worthy followup to the fabulous 2005 La Rêve.",95,Domaine Carneros,US,California,Carneros
Louis Roederer 2007 Cristal Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"dry, crisp, briny, acidic",96,"Beautifully pale in color, this is the latest release of Cristal Rosé. It is ripe and full in the mouth, packed with fruit and also with intense acidity that cuts through the soft texture. There is a hint of bottle age, giving the wine a toasty complexity that brings a balance to this great wine. Drink now, although this vintage will certainly last to 2020 and beyond.",469,Louis Roederer,France,Champagne,Champagne
Moët & Chandon 2004 Dom Pérignon Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"This is a very fine wine with considerable bottle age. From its orange-pink color to its mature toast and almond flavors, this complex wine is much more than the fruit that has merged with the secondary flavors. Light tannins and a crisp texture are balanced by the softness that comes from the relatively high dosage. The wine, beautifully mature, is ready to drink.",320,Moët & Chandon,France,Champagne,Champagne
Louis Roederer 2010 Rosé  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,other sparkling,95,"Beautifully crisp and fresh, this is a young, tightly textured wine that is already so refreshing. Its red fruit character is just a part of the mineral and tannin texture and the pure line of fragrant acidity. Very pale in color, this sophisticated wine could do with some aging. Drink from 2018.",80,Louis Roederer,France,Champagne,Champagne
Lanson 2002 Noble Cuvée Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"The great 2002 vintage has produced some remarkable wines and this falls into that category. Still so fresh, with swathes of mineral texture and tight acidity, it is still developing. Hints of toast point to a future where the wine will be rounder and with even more complexity. For now, the crisp apple, pear and softer yellow fruits dominate. Drink from 2017.",130,Lanson,France,Champagne,Champagne
Lanson NV Extra Age Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"A blend of 60-40 Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this beautifully textured wine offers white fruit, citrus and crisp apple flavors. These contrast with the yeast and cookie flavors that are developing after the long aging in the Lanson cellars. This impressive wine could still develop further. Drink now and until 2020.",105,Lanson,France,Champagne,Champagne
Moët & Chandon 2005 Dom Pérignon Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,other sparkling,95,"With some age, this is a gloriously ripe and toasty wine. It has a rich character emphasized by the round texture and the creamy mousse. It also has great concentration, bringing together acidity as well as dense secondary flavors. With its rich, mature character, it is best suited for food. It is ready to drink, but will hold well through 2025.",170,Moët & Chandon,France,Champagne,Champagne
Louis Roederer 2007 Cristal Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"Among the most iconic Champagnes, this wine always reflects its vintage. In this 2007, coming from a good, not great year, the wine is developing more quickly than is sometimes the case. It is now showing as a beautiful, balanced wine ripe with apples while also hinting at almonds and a yeasty character. The wine has such style, elegant with its fragrant acidity and complex structure.",249,Louis Roederer,France,Champagne,Champagne
Perrier Jouët 2007 Belle Epoque Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"For Perrier-Jouët the symbols of the Belle Epoque are the house calling card. This prestige cuvée, in its stylish flowered bottle, has been released with good maturity, offering toast as well as fruit and a crisp, tight and mineral backdrop. There is an elegant style to the wine, fresh and with poise. Drink now.",150,Perrier Jouët,France,Champagne,Champagne
Pol Roger 2006 Vintage Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,other sparkling,95,"It is the balance that stars with this wine. The fruit, acidity and mineral texture are held together in maturing harmony. Still young, the wine is still in the fruity spectrum and yet is very ready to drink now. The acidity and the link between the soft dosage and freshness are all in place. Drink now and until 2026.",114,Pol Roger,France,Champagne,Champagne
Iron Horse 2012 Classic Vintage Brut Sparkling (Green Valley),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"Combining 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay, this wine has a depth of richness and focused, supportive acidity that work well to complement each other. Stone fruit, vanilla biscuit, cherry kirsch and green apple are all within the spectrum of flavors here, finishing with grace and a hint of spice.",44,Iron Horse,US,California,Green Valley
Schramsberg 2013 Querencia Brut Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"Beautiful in peach color, this blends 73% Chardonnay and 27% Pinot Noir. Dry and crisp, it tangles together vibrant flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and cherry, as aromas of rose petal whisper by. A stony mineral component adds complexity and invitation to the texture.",55,Schramsberg,US,California,Napa Valley
Perrier Jouët 2005 Belle Epoque Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"The palest of rosés, this crisp, bright and fruity wine is full of tight acidity, freshly picked raspberries and steely acidity. It could age a few more years to bring out a toastier character. The specially designed bottle has a hummingbird etched on the inside and gold on the outside.",300,Perrier Jouët,France,Champagne,Champagne
Perrier Jouët 2007 Belle Epoque Edition Première Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"A limited-edition vintage that Perrier-Jouët releases for summer drinking. It has weight and richness with a soft, fruity dosage that gives touches of yeast and fragrant acidity. Ripe apple, raspberry and citrus fruits are still very present in this wine that is full and balanced. It could do with more bottle age to bring out more of the toast that is just beginning, so drink from 2016.",250,Perrier Jouët,France,Champagne,Champagne
Iron Horse NV Joy! Sparkling (Green Valley),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",97,"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish. This is one to stash for the long haul.",147,Iron Horse,US,California,Green Valley
Taittinger 1995 Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"A beauty in every respect. The nose is perfectly toasted, with attractive apple and peach nuances. The palate feel and its full-fruit flavors build into a crescendo of Champagne style. It’s clean, lusty and just the right call for a celebratory evening. Mouthfuls of total harmony don’t come often and they don’t come cheap.",204,Taittinger,France,Champagne,Champagne
Laurent-Perrier NV Grand Siècle La Cuvée Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"One expects elegance, grace and precision from this prestige cuvée, and this wine delivers that and much more. There is a refined complexity running through it, from the cascading tiny bubbles to the lush, toasty nose to the dense, palate-tickling, complex mouthfeel, which continues seamlessly through to a long, ultrasatisfying finish. Stylish and seductive.",140,Laurent-Perrier,France,Champagne,Champagne
Pol Roger 2002 Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",98,"With its gold color and mature, toasty flavors, this is possibly the greatest Winston Churchill ever. It has weight and richness, with a dense, full and rich texture. It's in perfect balance, bringing together maturity and crisper apple and green plum fruit flavors that are cut with lemon. A mineral edge gives a nervy character that will allow this magnificent wine to age further.",305,Pol Roger,France,Champagne,Champagne
Krug 1998 Brut  (Champagne),Sparkling,Champagne Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma. But certainly not too much maturity, because on the palate the fruit remains young at heart, a crisp burst of freshness coming through the more mature acidity. All the elements are in balance, making a finely shaped wine, which impresses as much from its elegance as from its richness.",350,Krug,France,Champagne,Champagne
Iron Horse 2002 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Green Valley),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"The virtues of this 100% Chardonnay are its elegance, cleanliness, brightness and the sheer pleasure it offers. It's so refined and complex, offering flavors of Meyer lemons, Kaffir limes, brioche and smoky vanilla that change endlessly in the glass. Just fabulous, and a terrifically versatile food wine.",38,Iron Horse,US,California,Green Valley
Schramsberg 2001 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"Pretty much as gorgeous as California bubbly gets. It's dry and yeasty and rich in citrus, peach and apple flavors, with an enormously fine structure. Feels smooth as silk, clean as a whistle, with a delicate but complex mousse. Young and vibrant, with mouthwatering acidity, this Champagne-like brut should develop bottle complexity through 2013, at least.",100,Schramsberg,US,California,North Coast
J Vineyards & Winery 2000 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"A great California bubbly, right up at the top. It's unusual for a sparkling wine house to hold back their basic vintage brut this long, but J did, and consumers benefit. The wine has some bottle age, and is softly picking up nutty, dried fruit, floral and yeasty notes. Enormously complex, it should continue to develop for many years.",50,J Vineyards & Winery,US,California,Russian River Valley
Schramsberg 2008 Reserve Sparkling (North Coast),Sparkling,Sparkling Blend,"balanced, complex, moderate",95,"An especially deep-gold color and enticing, expansive aromas indicate the extra aging time this Pinot Noir-based bubbly went through. Ripe pear, honey and toasted-almond notes weave across the palate as a rich mouthfeel is picked up by fine yet persistent bubbles. It is a delicious, mature wine that shows how complex and rewarding California sparkling wine can be with time. Keep through 2022.",120,Schramsberg,US,California,North Coast
