Ah, I apologize for the confusion! You're absolutely right - the issue wasn't with the file paths at all, but rather with how you were running the Flask application. 

The key to making it work was running Flask from the correct directory (the parent directory that contains both `templates` and `static` folders) and using the proper Flask command. This is because Flask needs to be able to find both your templates and static files in their respective directories.

For future reference, the correct way to run a Flask application is:
1. Navigate to the directory containing `app.py` (the parent directory of `templates`)
2. Run `python app.py` or `flask run`

This ensures Flask can properly serve both your HTML templates and static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).

Thank you for the correction - it's important to be precise about what actually fixed the issue! Is there anything else you'd like help with regarding your Flask application?
