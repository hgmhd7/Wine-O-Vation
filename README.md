# Group_Project_3  ### Wine Machine Learning.  

This is a machine learning project to predict the score of a wine based on reduced set of variables.  The data was scraped from [Wine Enthusiast](http://www.winemag.com/?s=&amp;drink_type=wine)  We started with 14 columns and 130k rows. The features were country, points, a description, a designation, price, province, region1, region2, the taster name, the taster twitter handle, wine name, variety and winery. We reduced the features down using machine learning to predict the points as a target variable.   ![bottle_glass_wc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33405945/66175955-612a9280-e621-11e9-908a-7b4c4b364f98.png)
